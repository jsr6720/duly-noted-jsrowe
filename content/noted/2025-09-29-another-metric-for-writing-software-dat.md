> At Meta, a diff is a pull request and DAT focuses on the inner development loop â€“ the writing, building, testing, and debugging of code. The tech giant emphasizes diffs should be kept small and reviewable, which, in part, accounts for its average DAT of 50 minutes across 87% of available diffs.

I feel like it's the continuous application of scientific management (Taylorism) here that fall short. Gallup has found time and again that effective workers have a lot more to do with environment than DATs..
