> Microsoft has bet an awful lot on generative AI tech, and by making Copilot opt-out rather than opt-in, the company can show figures to shareholders that AI is going swimmingly and it hasn't made a terrible, terrible mistake. The same applies to Apple, Google, and many others in the tech industry.

Would agree that there are a lot of dollars chasing a product there. But I do think that AI is both novel and useless enough to warrant some nudging by companies. No one asked for cup holders in cars, but would you buy a car without one now?

Do make sure you check with your employer before downloading AI tools though...
