> "Well, you know, I was raised on Star Trek, and all the good ideas come from Star Trek. So I said what if we could just do it all electronically? What if I could store an image electronically, capture an image electronically, and I don't require any film at all?"

> "I wanted to build a camera with no moving parts. Now that was just to annoy the mechanical engineers. Most cameras at the time were mechanical marvels, and I couldn't build a mechanical camera to save my life. So I thought, since these guys are the cream of the crop, I'll just make one with no moving parts, and that'll annoy the hell out of them."
