> Petulance aside, tests from earlier this year found that AI agents failed to complete tasks up to 70% of the time, making them almost entirely redundant as a workforce replacement tool. At best, they're a way for skilled employees to be more productive and save time on low-level tasks, but those tasks were already being handed off to lower-level employees. Having an AI do it and fail half the time isn't exactly a winning alternative.

I think the problem is that copilot in MSFT suite products just isn't compelling. Excel needs real numbers, you can LLM your way to a balance sheet. Outlook needs tight focused emails. PPTX again succinctness is critical. 

That leaves word, and one likes reading 10 pages of slop. And this coming from a guy who uses AI everyday to code. PS GitHub copilot feels like a laggard to Codex, Claude Code and Cursor.
