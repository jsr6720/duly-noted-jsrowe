> GenAI appears to have highly addictive qualities. I am not a psychologist, psychiatrist, counselor, or trained mental health expert - but I certainly feel like I might be getting addicted. Areas where I used to feel confident in my own skills and abilities — like writing concise, thorough, balanced emails — have now become areas where I consistently reach out to AI for feedback. The 2015 version of me would be quite disturbed.

but what happens once you accumulate those improvements into real skills? I dunno, I think engaging with the emerging tech is no different then when I used to come to the 'last page on the internet'.
