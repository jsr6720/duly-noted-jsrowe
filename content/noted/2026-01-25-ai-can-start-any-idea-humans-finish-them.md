> In my experience, projects generated exclusively by AI without human intervention invariably result in “spaghetti code”that is next to impossible to maintain, and extend. While AI is great at generating “boilerplate” (the repetitive parts of a program), it cannot replicate the critical thinking required to make high-level architectural decisions.
