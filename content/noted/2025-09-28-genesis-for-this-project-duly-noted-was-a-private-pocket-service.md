> We made the difficult decision to shut down Pocket on July 8, 2025, with only the Pocket Web data export page live until October 8, 2025. Thank you for being part of our journey over the years â€“ we're proud of the impact Pocket has had for our users and communities.

Just a reminder (I think I noted this before) that any service-even ones you pay for-can go out like a light tomorrow.
