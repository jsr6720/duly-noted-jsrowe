> “Think of concepts as modules that are completely clean and independent. Synchronizations then act like contracts — they say exactly how concepts are supposed to interact. That’s powerful because it makes the system both easier for humans to understand and easier for tools like LLMs to generate correctly,” says Jackson. “Why can’t we read code like a book? We believe that software should be legible and written in terms of our understanding: our hope is that concepts map to familiar phenomena, and synchronizations represent our intuition about what happens when they come together,” says Meng. 

Not going to lie. This article reads like someone who has never built a complex system. The reason why you can't read software like a book is it's more like a guest log at a hotel lobby. Hundreds if not thousands of engineers leave their imprint on it over decades.

And the DSL pitch.. oh man. Nothing solves software organization problems like.. more software.

Would suggest looking more at Bounded Domain context development.
