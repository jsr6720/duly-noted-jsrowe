> GraphQL solves a real problem, but that problem is far more niche than people admit. In most enterprise setups, it’s already solved elsewhere, and when you add up the tradeoffs, GraphQL often ends up being a net negative.

At all companies I've worked at. The best query for the job was the one that was most optimized for the front-end.
