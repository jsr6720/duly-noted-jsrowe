>  Before starting tasks, developers forecast that allowing AI will reduce completion time by 24%. After completing the study, developers estimate that allowing AI reduced completion time by 20%. Surprisingly, we find that allowing AI actually increases completion time by 19%—AI tooling slowed developers down. This slowdown also contradicts predictions from experts in economics (39% shorter) and ML (38% shorter).

This report made the rounds. the aha study showing a slowdown. But here's my take.

1. This study did not include CLI, only cursor. So you had both a retooling expense and frankly early 2025 is still very new for coding agents. 
2. Open Source software is notoriously slow by design. And frankly as soon as any committee driven process detects something new it slows down to a fault.

I think in short. They should continue to measure productivity in this manner and see how things evolve over time. No amount of its 20% slower overall replaces the FOMO happening on boards right now.
