> Look, the economics of this just don’t make sense and the “what trillion dollar problem will AI solve?” question takes up a lot of space in my brain. I see people talking about the limited ways in which they work with it now, and wonder what happens when the bill comes due. We wouldn’t, as a society, pay a trillion dollars to solve those problems. Not even close.

While I'd say I'm still excited to talk about how AI is improving *some* things that I do, and especially helps me code from time to time. Just today claude latest decided to define two `const` variables in the same file.. So yea..

The other answer is that big tech has been sitting on literally billions of dollars and they found something to try and conquer. Thats where the money is coming from. I think they speculate that one AI will rule them all like google did to search. But imo its looking more like specific models with specific training datasets will be applied to specific workflows.
