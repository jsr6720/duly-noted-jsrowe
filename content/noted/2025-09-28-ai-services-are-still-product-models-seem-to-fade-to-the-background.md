> Microsoft is bringing Anthropicâ€™s Claude Sonnet 4 and Claude Opus 4.1 AI models to its Microsoft 365 Copilot today. ... Claude Sonnet 4 and Claude Opus 4.1 will also be available as model options in Copilot Studio

Well two things. 1. MSFT has long ago abandoned its MSFT first policies. I get though the sentiment of shock. but 2. for tech people the model is everything. for everyone else. its just another service. And I think companies recognize this.

its why OpenAI wants to create a new search engine and browser. 95% of the population isn't associating with a named model, despite what twitter would have you believe.
