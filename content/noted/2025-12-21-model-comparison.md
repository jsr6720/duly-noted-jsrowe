> Flash 3 with thinking disabled is smarter, faster, and cheaper than its closest competition Haiku 4.5, and while it's not quite as smart as GPT-5 mini (with default reasoning), it's about the same price and 8x faster. Meanwhile, GPT-5 mini gives up significantly more intelligence with reasoning dialed back to minimal (the lowest 5 mini can go).

I dunno. I *feel* like I get better results with thinking models. But what do I know. I couldn't empirically defend that.
