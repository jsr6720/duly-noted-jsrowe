> In recent months, we’ve seen clear evidence that using GenAI to understand legacy codebases can significantly accelerate comprehension of large and complex systems... [and] help developers surface business rules, summarize logic and identify dependencies. Used alongside open frameworks and direct LLM prompting, they dramatically reduce the time needed to understand legacy codebases.

This is hands down my favorite use of LLMs. "Whats going on in this code base"
