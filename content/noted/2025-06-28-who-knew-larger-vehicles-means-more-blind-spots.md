> The IIHS came up with an easier way to repeatably measure and compare what a driver can see in a 180-degree forward-facing view out of a vehicle. The method involves a special portable camera rig that captures a driver's view. That image is then processed to determine what percentage of the road in a specified radius is visible, and what's blocked by the vehicle's A-pillars, hood, and side-view mirrors. The result is an aerial view of where the driver's vision is obstructed—the blind zone—as well as a percentage of the surrounding area that's visible.

Feels like every new vehicle is more concerned about looking like a tank than just getting people to a destination.
