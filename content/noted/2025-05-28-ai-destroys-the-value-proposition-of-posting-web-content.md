> 75 percent of the queries that get put into Google get answered without you leaving Google, get answered on that page. So if you want to ask, when did David Rubenstein start Carlyle? About ten years ago it would take you to maybe a Wikipedia page or something else. Today, the answer comes up right on the page, and you don’t have to go anywhere else. The consequence of that means that original content creators that are creating that content, if they were deriving value through selling subscriptions or putting up ads, or just the ego of knowing that someone is reading your stuff, that’s gone, right? That’s has fallen off a cliff. And that’s the good news. So it was two to one ten years ago for Google. It’s six to one today. What do you think it is for OpenAI? 250 to one. What do you think it is for Anthropic? Six thousand to one, right?

File me under 'the ego of knowing that someone is reading your stuff'. I think I've proven that I do this without charging anything, but my AWS bill is literally pennies. I greatly enjoy original content. Here's hoping people continue to post their thoughts online. Its blogs all the way down.
