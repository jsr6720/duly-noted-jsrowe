> While some believe no-code or “vibe coding” tools (where users prompt agents to write software) might eliminate the need for technical expertise, Dohmke disagrees. He sees these tools as accelerators, not replacements. “The idea that AI without any coding skills lets you build a billion-dollar business is mistaken — because if that were true, everyone would be doing it.”

I feel this, for ever reddit post I read about someone POWERing through AI Development I think. Show me the money. I think I noted this elsewhere before. The great geniuses who invited Java and C# aren't the ones who brough Applications to life. Try as I might, even my best simplest vibe-coding experiments reach the 95% threashold of compeltion. Sure right now businesses are shy about hiring, but I think this is more driven by over supply in the market of qualified engineers and global competition. The world is flat.
