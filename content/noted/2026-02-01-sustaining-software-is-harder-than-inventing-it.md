> A few days ago I started being bombarded with hype posts about Clawdbot. I sincerely believe this is another instance of software “pump and dump”. Today after opening Linkedin the first three posts are #lookingforwork CTOs hyping Clawdbot as the next big thing. After taking a quick look at the project I have concluded that it is an unsecure mess and a vibecoded software blob that will be forgotten in a few months

Whats that they say about bullshit in a tree?
