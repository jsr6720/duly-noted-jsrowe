> My goal is to eliminate every line of C and C++ from Microsoft by 2030. Our strategy is to combine AI *and* Algorithms to rewrite Microsoft’s largest codebases. Our North Star is “1 engineer, 1 month, 1 million lines of code”.   To accomplish this previously unimaginable task, we’ve built a powerful code processing infrastructure. Our algorithmic infrastructure creates a scalable graph over source code at scale. Our AI processing infrastructure then enables us to apply AI agents, guided by algorithms, to make code modifications at scale. The core of this infrastructure is already operating at scale on problems such as code understanding.

This made the rounds as ivory tower meets unrealistic outcomes. But I want to give a hat tip to someone trying it. It's easy to say "stupid" "won't work". And know what. when I first read this I thought the same thing.

But then I wondered. What if he pulls this off. What if language of choice becomes just a mechanism of choosing your operating stack. We already enjoy cross platform games. why not cross platform software? 

Dream big Galen Hunt, I'm interested to see what you find out. Because even if the answer is "no it doesn't work like that" discovering the upper bounds is just as important as finding the meaty middle.
