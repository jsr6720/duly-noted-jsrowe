> The Guiding and Establishing National Innovation for U.S. Stablecoins (GENIUS) Act was signed into law June 18, establishing a regulatory framework for the issuance and transaction of payment stablecoins in the U.S. The law goes into effect 18 months after enactment (December 2026) or 120 days after the Federal Reserve Board (FRB), the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC), the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. (FDIC) and the National Credit Union Administration (NCUA) issue final regulations, whichever is earlier.

Will be interesting to see how stable-coins affect the market
