> Code review, however, emerged as the most significant challenge. Reviewing the generated code line by line across all changes took me approximately 20 minutes. Unlike pairing with a human developer—where iterative discussions occur at a manageable pace—working with an AI system capable of generating entire modules within seconds creates a bottleneck on the human side, especially when attempting line-by-line scrutiny. This isn’t a limitation of the AI itself, but rather a reflection of human review capacity.

Accelerating writing code is fantastic. But without hand writing you lose the deep connection and understanding to the application. Just recently I skimmed a delta and missed that ai had chosen two info statements and two debug statements. Why did it do it this way? I have no idea. had I copy pasted it would have all been info statements..
