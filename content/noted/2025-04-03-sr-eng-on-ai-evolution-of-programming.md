> When I got stuck with a problem, I had two options: PRINT commands and a lot of dedication, or back to the library. Debugging at that time meant: running, hitting an error, searching, adjusting, and running again with fingers crossed. But in my view, this is just the next step in a long evolution of developer tools.

>Eclipse, Firebase, and Stack Overflow haven't replaced developers, and AI won't make us obsolete either. Instead, it creates some space for what really matters in software development: creativity, innovation, understanding what the customer wants, and solving complex problems. You could even say that productivity doesn't increase, but expectations do. ... AI functioned as a private tutor who could communicate exactly at my level.

This is the kind of analysis from an expert that in my mind confirms (bias) that AI can be great at navigating documentation and building quick tools. But mastery lie in the details.
