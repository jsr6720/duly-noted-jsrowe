The chart showing Assets (M2) closely correlated to Debt until it diverged strongly during the pandemic jumped out at me. I'm not clear how how this affects my household, but it does seem evident that decades of debt financing is having a material impact on this trend.

> As one can see, the series tracked each other closely until about mid-2022. By January 2025, the latest data point available, M2 was about 44% above its 2016-19 average while debt held by the public was about 65% higher than its 2016-19 average.
