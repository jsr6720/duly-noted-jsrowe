> Use a popular stack and popular libraries with older versions (React, FastAPI, Python, etc). LLMs are less likely to make mistakes when writing code that they've already seen in their training data

Some lessons from the trenches. This one I think will carry more weight in the future. "What languages are in the training model"

The use of a mono-repo is also an interesting development with AI
