> Another looming problem for genAI is copyright. Most AI firms are either being sued for using content without permission or entering costly contracts to licences content.
> Progress on genAI could stall, too, leaving consumers with “good enough” tools that are free to use. In that scenario, AI firms may become less important, the technology a little less powerful — and that might be perfectly OK. Users would still benefit from accessible, functional tools while being spared from another round of overhyped pitches doomed to fail.

I agree with these two takes. 1. Lawsuits will make scraping all data in the future harder and 2. if deep seek has proven anything is that perfectly "fine" tools can be built without spending any more billions on frontier models.
