> The theme of my journey can be summarized in one word: “intrapreneur”. It’s a portmanteau of “internal” and “entrepreneur” and a style of leadership I’ve used over and over for my own career success, and that of tech professionals whom I’ve coached.

I mean the key thing here is that excelling in your role isn't an act of silos. Besides leading from the front at your w2 job is infinitely easier than starting your own company.
