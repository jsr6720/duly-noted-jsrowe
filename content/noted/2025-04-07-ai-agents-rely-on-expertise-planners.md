> The core idea is to separate the process into distinct components: a Planner, an Evaluator, and an Executor. The Planner generates a plan based on the userâ€™s query. The Evaluator validates the generated plan. The Executor only executes plans that have been validated, ensuring that only sound plans are carried out.

And I guess the human rubber stamps it? No where is mentioned controlling for mistakes.
