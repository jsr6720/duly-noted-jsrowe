> Of course, humans aren’t factually correct 100% of the time either. The difference is that humans have the potential for self-awareness; we can catch ourselves in a mistake and pivot at any moment. This potential does not exist in an ‘AI’ system. Once an LLM is on a track, it treats its own previous output as the absolute foundation for what comes next. It does not ‘fact check’ itself; it only ‘consistency checks’ itself. If it makes an error, it will often compound that error to maintain the flow, spiraling into a loop of fabrications. There is a human equivalent to this, and we call it delusion.

> If you’re a senior developer, you already understand architecture, tradeoffs, design patterns, naming conventions, debugging, etc.., and that foundation lets you guide the AI to get the best result (even if it needs some cleanup).

great deep dive on delegation patterns and the danger of losing touch with code.
