> Thune, a fourth-term senator from South Dakota, is an awkward leader for Trump’s ruthless Republican Party, in part because even Democrats invariably describe him as amiable and honest.

Excellent tracing of the new Senate majoriyt leader's rise to power and what it means for the separation of powers when the current Executive Branch is pursuing rule by fiat.
