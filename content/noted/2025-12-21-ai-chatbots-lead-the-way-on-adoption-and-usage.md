> More than four in 10 employees surveyed in Q2 2025 who used AI at least yearly indicated that they used AI technology to consolidate information (42%) and generate ideas (41%) and 36% said they used it to learn new things. What employees reported using AI for did not change meaningfully from Gallup’s initial measure in Q2 2024.

I have to remember that working in software means I'm getting a lot more value from AI than probably 99% of other use cases.

ps gallup. I love your `.aspx` extension.
