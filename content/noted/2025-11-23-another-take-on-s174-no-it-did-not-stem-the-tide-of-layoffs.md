> Whether it’ll manage to counteract the scale of recent layoffs, Siri is less certain. “I do believe companies will start hiring developers in the US again because it makes sense now with the fix,” he says. “Ultimately the economy is weaker and people are spending more cautiously, so I doubt the hiring numbers will match what we’re seeing with layoffs.”.

Came back to this to capture it for my commonplace book. No it didnt' stem the tide of layoffs. As I mentioned the economics of software development have morphed. Small onshore teams augmented by off-shore teams seems to be the standard arrangement.
