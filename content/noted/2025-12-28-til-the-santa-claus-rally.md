> The S&P 500 rode thin trading volume on Tuesday to mark its 38th record close of the year. The Santa Claus rally period is on deck.

Time in market beats timing the market. I had thought about shifting some more to bonds in q4. glad I didn't. There are other people posting that statistically s&p 500 is due for a correction. Guess its not this year.
