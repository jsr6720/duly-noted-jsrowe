> There is, however, some skepticism around the extent to which AI is truly responsible for layoffs. “As a founder, seeking investments, of a company that’s in a public market that trades stock, you don’t want to rattle the market and say ‘Oh we’re actually in a really tough position because we can’t borrow money cheaply and the economic condition isn’t great,’” said Mr. Vu, “You want to be able to at least try to shape the narrative on why your company’s headcount isn’t growing as quickly as it should, and in fact right now, AI certainly seems like a good reason to attribute that to.”

Would agree there was probably way more poor business decisions than money on the table with automations.
