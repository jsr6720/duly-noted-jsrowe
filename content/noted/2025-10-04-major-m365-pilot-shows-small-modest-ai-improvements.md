> Small time savings were observed across most use cases, with written tasks presenting
the largest time savings. However, some tasks, like scheduling and generating images,
incurred additional time to complete the task when participants used M365 Copilot.
Additional time to complete tasks was primarily caused by either M365 Copilot being
unable to produce high quality outputs or the task being additional workload only
completed due to users having M365 Copilot. The evaluation did not find evidence that
time savings have led to improved productivity, and control group participants had not
observed productivity improvements from colleagues taking part in the M365 Copilot pilot.
However, many pilot participants reported noticing time savings in their own roles due to
M365 Copilot.

this is a good research paper from the UK gov detailing how AI can speed up some tasks but over generate slop in others.
