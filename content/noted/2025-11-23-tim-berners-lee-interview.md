> Yes, I do see that split, and as an application platform, I’m concerned if the AI does not feed the search engine, or doesn’t feed the blogs or the podcasts. To the extent that AI reads everything on the web and then helps you live your life by using that. One of the things I talked about in the book is that you need an AI that works for you. If it’s only running off the external data out there, if it doesn’t have access to your own personal data, AI won’t be able to do a good job helping you in your life.

> At my company, Inrupt, we’ve built a version of AI, a thing called Charlie, that does have access to all your personal data in your data wallet. So an AI that does that is much more powerful. Without that ability to act on your behalf — without promising to work on your best interests, like your doctor or your lawyer, who take oaths and are culturally bound to support the best interests of the client, not of the person who pays them. I feel that AIs that work for you are going to be a really important part of the scene.

I mean this is an important distinction. Why would you ever trust a server based AI that has no confidential requirements?
