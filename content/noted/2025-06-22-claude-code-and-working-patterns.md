> With AI, code is becoming really cheap. This means that you can now build stuff that you only ever use once without feeling bad about it. Everything that you wish would make your current task easier can just be created out of thin air.

Fits in with being more ambitious because the cost of writing code is zero. But knowing what code to write is priceless. Also some good ideas on gitworkrees and task delegation. One thing I wish was more detailed was how he collects all the threads loops. Like does he kick off a bunch of threads and then look at them one by one? Humans are still single threaded least I checked..
