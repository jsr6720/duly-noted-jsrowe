> Redoing work is now extremely cheap. Code in the small is less important than structural patterns and organisation of the code in the large. You can also build lots of prototypes to test an idea out. For this, vibe-coding is great, as long as the prototype is thrown away and rewritten properly later.

This is fitting my better understanding of the shift in software development from vibe coding (hello Ruby on Rails would like a word) and using prompts to build design docs to THEN build software.
