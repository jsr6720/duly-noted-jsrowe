Math on why subscriptions are pushed so heavily. Seems to be the only viable path to developer sustainability for Apps in the App Store. 

I mean at revenue ARR of $360 you'd need a lot of apps to feed yourself...

> After a year, the top 5 percent of apps in most categories, including gaming, photo and video, health and fitness, and social and lifestyle, make more than $5,000/month. The 25th percentile makes $5 to $20 per month, depending on the category, save for photo and video apps, whereas the bottom quartile makes $32 per month.
