> I was describing GitHub Copilot. Or Claude Codex. Or OpenAI lmnop6.5 ultra watermelon. This isn’t about tools or productivity or acceleration. It’s about the illusion of progress. Because if that programmer-if that thing, that CREATURE-walked into your stand-up in human form, typing half-correct garbage into your codebase while ignoring your architecture and disappearing during cleanup, you’d fire them before they could say 'no blockers'.

A hilarious takedown of the bolder claims of AI coding. The truth is, AI does a great job of orienting and summarizing. But co-pilot.. please. Or as Jj offers 'Copilot isn’t that. It’s just the ghost of a thousand blog posts and cocky stack-overflow posts'. Real.
