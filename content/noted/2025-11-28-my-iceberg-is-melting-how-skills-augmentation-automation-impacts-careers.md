> Every Revolution Needs a New Metric:
> Industrial era →Output per hour (measured physical productivity)
> Internet era →Digital economy accounts (captured online service value)
> Intelligence era →Skills-centered measure (reveals AI-human skill overlap)

Another index to try and track the displacement effect of AI. But this one focuses on skills not roles. Which is both more specific and likely harder to track. Wish there was more depth (should I say hidden iceberg mass?) to this article. not much on the hard skills they're measuring.
