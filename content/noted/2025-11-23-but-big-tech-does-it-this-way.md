> Very few companies are shaped like Facebook, and therefore decisions that make sense for Facebook probably don’t make sense for you. It’s ironic, tragic even, that so many people think that tools that make sense for Facebook will automatically make sense for their own organizations.

Right up there with "google does it this way".. Its lazy thinking to correlate your pre-seed idea with a billion dollar company.
