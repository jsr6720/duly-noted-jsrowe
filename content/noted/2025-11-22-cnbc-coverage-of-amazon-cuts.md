> Amazon
’s 14,000-plus layoffs announced last month touched almost every piece of the company’s sprawling business, from cloud computing and devices to advertising, retail and grocery stores. But one job category bore the brunt of cuts more than others: engineers.
> 
> Documents filed in New York, California, New Jersey and Amazon’s home state of Washington showed that nearly 40% of the more than 4,700 job cuts in those states were engineering roles. The data was reported by Amazon in Worker Adjustment and Retraining Notification, or WARN, filings to state agencies.

Almost quaint when you remember companies like Kodak/Xerox/AT&T used to run in house job retraining programs. I posted on this yesterday I think and yes. free cash flow is fine guys. 

Share holder supremacy wins agin.
