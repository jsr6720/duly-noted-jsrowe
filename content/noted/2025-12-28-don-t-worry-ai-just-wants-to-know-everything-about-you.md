> Over the past two years, generative AI tools—such as OpenAI’s ChatGPT and Google’s Gemini—have moved beyond the relatively straightforward, text-only chatbots that the companies initially released. Instead, Big AI is increasingly building and pushing toward the adoption of agents and “assistants” that promise they can take actions and complete tasks on your behalf. The problem? To get the most out of them, you’ll need to grant them access to your systems and data.

Frankly, I find this both terrifying and most useful. obviously it would be great to have an AI agent that understands my personal preferences. But letting a robot go off and book a plane ticket for me. Hard stop.

This is another reason I pay for my AI access, but I worry even my measly 20 bucks a month won't be nearly the value OpenAI can resell my data for.

Good read on the dangers of all-in on AI (yes poking fun at myself)
