> Regarding vibe coding, Torvalds described himself as "fairly positive" – but not for kernel development. Computers have become more complicated than when he learned to code and was "typing in programs from computer magazines." Vibe coding, he said, is a great way for people to "get computers to do something that maybe they couldn't do otherwise." This is despite the fact that vibe coding "may be a horrible, horrible idea from a maintenance standpoint."

Agreed. Vibe your prototypes. Code your production
