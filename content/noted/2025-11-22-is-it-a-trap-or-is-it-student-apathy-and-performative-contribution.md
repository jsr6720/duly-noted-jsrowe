> I had at least eight students come to my office to make their case against the allegations, but not a single one of them could explain to me what Marxism is, how it worked as an analytical lens or how it even made its way into their papers they claimed to have written. The most shocking part was that apparently, when ChatGPT read the prompt, it even directly asked if it should include Marxism, and they all said yes. As one student said to me, “I thought it sounded smart.”

I think the challenge here is less to do with AI and more to do with societal expectations for a college degree. Dunno I'm torn on this. On one hand "Don't copy Wikipedia" as a refrain my school years. But I met plenty of students who had no interest in reading Douglas Egerton’s book “Gabriel’s Rebellion" and writing a paper on it...
