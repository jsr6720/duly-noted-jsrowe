> I am increasingly distressed by the race to replace human developers, particularly the more junior ones, with AI assistants. ... Companies are jumping on AI as a way of removing those messy (and expensive) humans from the process of developing software.

I think the best observation is that "people don't know what they want". If AI Coding is the proverbial horse, then everyone wants a faster horse; no one will ask for the car. Most research I find and post here indicates a 10-20% overall productivity improvement, but really as Dave points out that efficiency will be filled with more [ambitious](https://simonwillison.net/2023/Mar/27/ai-enhanced-development/) work.
