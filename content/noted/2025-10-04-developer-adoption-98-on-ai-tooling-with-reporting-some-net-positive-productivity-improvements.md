SUMMARY
•
66% of respondents have adopted
AI tools in production.
• 85% are focused on internal
engineering use cases.
•
59% of respondents feel AI has
increased productivity.
The tooling landscape
Whether overzealous leaders have mandated
adoption or allowed engineers to discover these
tools themselves, it's safe to say that AI coding
assistants and large language models (LLMs)
are firmly part of the software developer's tool
belt today.
Two-thirds (66%) of respondents have adopted
AI tools or models for at least some use cases, with
20% at a pilot stage, and 13% still exploring. This
leaves just 2% who have no plans to use AI tools
or models.
```

Lots of charts and graphs in this report, but I'm left with a few observations

- bottom line. Engineers are Using AI/LLM . Either by force or self adoption
- future looks murky. there is still a need to guide AI but impact on JR roles questionable. I wonder if street lamp lighters felt this way as new fangled bulbs were installed
- there is still a negative effect to onboarding AI. this is a learning curve IMO
