> AI has collapsed product cycles from years to hours. This doesn’t mean product managers (PMs) are replacing engineers. It means they can now meet engineers halfway, with more fully-formed ideas, prototypes, and evidence that make collaboration faster and more meaningful. 

I agree with this take. And I hope that PMs can validate their ideas faster too!
