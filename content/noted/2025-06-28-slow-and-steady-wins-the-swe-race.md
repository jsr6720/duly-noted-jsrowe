> I think it’s actually the other way around. A truly great engineering organization is one where perfectly normal, workaday software engineers, with decent software engineering skills and an ordinary amount of expertise, can consistently move fast, ship code, respond to users, understand the systems they’ve built, and move the business forward a little bit more, day by day, week by week.

Agree completely. And besides have you ever tried to manage that many egos on one team? Too many chefs and not enough cooks is a problem too. The best restraunts in the world cannot function without the dish washer.
