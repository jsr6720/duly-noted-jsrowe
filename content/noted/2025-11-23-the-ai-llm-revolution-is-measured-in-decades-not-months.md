It will take years for them to get as smart as cats, and more years to get as smart as humans, let alone smarter (don't confuse the superhuman knowledge accumulation and retrieval abilities of current LLMs with actual intelligence).

I mean cats care clever. Great take from a real builder of AI systems, sorry to notice that I came across this post nearly a year later. And guess what. AI is still only as smart as a fern.
