> power turns people into selfish and insensitive jerks, who act as if the the rules that the rest of us have to follow don't apply to them... leaders who who are able to avoid the poison, and instead  focus on the needs of the people around them, are apparently more likely to lead more effective organizations.

Picking up some older pieces I've read. Bob Sutton originally wrote about \"The No Asshole Rule\" and its worth remembering that power corrupts and absolute power corrupts absolutely.
