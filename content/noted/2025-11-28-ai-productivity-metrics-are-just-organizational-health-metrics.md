> AI metrics can show:
> 
> How many and what types of developers are adopting AI tooling
> How much work and what kind is being touched by AI
> How much it costs
> Core engineering metrics show:
> 
> If teams are shipping faster
> If quality and reliability are increasing or decreasing
> If code maintainability is decreasing
> If AI tools are reducing friction in the developer workflow

I think this is great, you can measure how *much* engineers are utilizing AI but that doesn't tell you how good the impact is.

This framework is utilization -> impact -> cost. You don't want to pay for something no one is using, which is another signal as well.
