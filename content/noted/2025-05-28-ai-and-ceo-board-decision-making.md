> My exact words to a small group of our finance, legal and talent colleagues last week: 'You are committing career suicide if you're not aggressively experimenting with AI.'

The reality is, we don't know today how much AI will do in the future. But lots of companies are betting on a lot. Even if AI doesn't take your job, someone who is using AI will. Is the mantra I hear most repeated.
