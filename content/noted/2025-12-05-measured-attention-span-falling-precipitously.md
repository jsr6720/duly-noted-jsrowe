> It’s well documented that attention spans are declining rapidly. Gloria Mark, a psychologist at the University of California, Irvine, told the Speaking of Psychology podcast that the average attention span has dramatically decreased in recent years. "Back in 2004, we found the average attention span on any screen to be two-and-a-half minutes," she said.
> "Around 2012, it dropped to 75 seconds. In the last few years, it’s about 47 seconds—and the median is just 40 seconds."

I'll have to put on my list how they measure this. But regardless. the lesson is the same. focusing is a skill like anything else. It must be practiced to be perfected.
