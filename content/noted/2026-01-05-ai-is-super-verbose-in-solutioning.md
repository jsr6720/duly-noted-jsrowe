> So, have we all decided to just accept this?
- Filip Ganyicz


(picture showing AI generated code is almost 5x as long as 'hand-written' code)

I've had this same experience, and agree it can often take just as long to rein in a software solution as it takes to build it by hand.

I think the challenge is this comparison is only valid if you know the domain area in the first place.
