> So from an executive perspective, lighting comically large piles of money on fire trying to teach graphics cards how to read is, surprisingly, the logical play. The rest, well, that’s all just creative marketing. It’s very difficult to show up to a quarterly shareholder meeting and tell your investors you just vaporized another $10 billion for absolutely no return-on-investment. At least, that is, without them questioning if you’ve completely lost your mind. Which is where leaning into the hype plays into it.

> Tesla was able to keep investment flowing for over a decade by claiming each year that full self-driving was coming the very next year. Big Tech can easily do the same. “90% of our code is now AI.”, “we’re seeing spark of AGI.”, “we’re so worried that our super smart word processor will become sentient and kill everyone”. It’s all just vapid bluster designed to keep investors on board long enough for them to hopefully figure out a path to AGI. Fake it till you make it, but at an entire industry-wide scale.

I mean this is the AI bubble in a nutshell. for a decade the big tech companies have been accumulating a huge war chest. And 20B to a Trillion dollar company is just another bet. As AI takes over core parts of search and drafting its inevitable these companies will chase. Will see what happens when the music stops.
