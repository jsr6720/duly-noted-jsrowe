> OpenAI argues that copying the style of a movie studio, rather than of a living artist, is allowed. (I imagine Disney would not support this argument.) Yet other artists in the United States are already suing OpenAI, and other A.I. companies, for training its tools on their artwork and infringing on their styles

Understanding that AI can only generate what its been trained on, I think its quite obvious that all AI have a Copyright problem.
