> Economists’ way of thinking has fallen out of favor among the political class more broadly. The right has embraced Trump’s zero-sum worldview and lost faith in expertise generally. Many progressives have rejected economists’ fundamental focus on trade-offs and the unintended consequences of policy interventions. Both sides are down on the free market.

All this to say. Americans are hurting. Both from rising costs, corporate profits and international changes in exports/imports. I'm not an economist and know enough to shut up.
