> A study led by Thaiss that published in 2022 found that mice's gut microbiomes influence their motivation to exercise. The team found that in a diverse population of mice, those that were more inclined to run on their exercise wheels had different microbiomes than their sedentary brethren.

Fascinating research on how gut microbiome can impact motivation.
