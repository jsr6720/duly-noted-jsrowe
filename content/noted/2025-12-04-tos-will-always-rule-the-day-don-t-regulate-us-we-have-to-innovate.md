> According to data released by OpenAI last month, roughly three million ChatGPT users display signs of serious mental health emergencies like emotional reliance on AI, psychosis, mania, and self-harm, with roughly more than a million users talking to the chatbot about suicide every week.

I really don't understand why this is a problem. They (OpenAI) have NO problem detecting threats to protected classes. Surely they could detect threats of self harm... 

(title is sarcasm in case you can't tell)
