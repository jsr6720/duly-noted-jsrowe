> Enterprises do not ship notebooks. They ship systems. They need predictable performance, sustainable maintainability, strong operability, and clear contracts. They need guardrails, type guarantees, stable runtimes, and concurrency that scales with real workloads. At that point, Python’s strengths begin to look fragile.

What do you think enterprise teams with decades of experience with Java are going to choose? Thats right more java. I think this is doubly true as enterprises learn how to add context-aware training of their proprietary code on premise. 

Its always cheaper to extend an existing system than build a new one from scratch.
