> Rodbard suggests that the analog version of the recipe blog, the cookbook, might be due for a comeback. Cookbooks, after all, offer the same experience of spending time and learning from a trusted source, and it’s likely the recipes have been tested.

Would agree. Even basics like shortbread cookies aren't always right.

Bonus tip. Just go to the library.
