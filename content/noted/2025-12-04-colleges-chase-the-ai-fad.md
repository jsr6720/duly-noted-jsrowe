> Administrators understandably want to “future proof” their graduates at a time when the workforce is rapidly transforming. But such policies represent a dangerously hasty and uninformed response to the technology. Based on the available evidence, the skills that future graduates will most need in the AI era—creative thinking, the capacity to learn new things, flexible modes of analysis—are precisely those that are likely to be eroded by inserting AI into the educational process.

I have my own opinion on this. But 1. colleges often rush to establish departments on hot topics and 2. the reality is college has been compressed, because of tuition expense, into the fastest path to employment.

And thats not wrong, but if my tuition was 70k a year instead of 20k you can bet I'm skipping on electives like philosophy, and literature.
