```
I really love the possibility of giving it tasks - e.g., given the last invoice from AWS, investigate quick wins to reduce the cost - and focus on other tasks. It feels like proper multitasking. Then go back to it when I have the time, understand the results, and either create an action for the agent itself or for me.
And I like the blank-canvas push it can give when you need that little kick to start building. It's truly amazing.
LLMs are such a fantastic technology; it really feels like magic.

This guy gets it. His post is literally what I would say too. Right down to hating LInkedIn now...
