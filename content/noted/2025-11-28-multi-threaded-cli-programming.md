> But we’re in new territory now that any dev can kick off parallel coding with coding agents. Will it make engineers more productive, or will it just make people feel like they’re more productive? Perhaps engineers who do one thing at a time and keep focus will be shown to produce more reliable software, over time. Or maybe it’ll turn out that working with parallel agents leads to more issues slipping through and more iterations, which destroys any gains.

Agreed. have been using multiple agents myself as well. But driven more by the fact that one agent takes longer than my next thought. But when it comes to deep work studying and iterating are still my longest cognitive tasks.
