> In response, Suleyman said it "cracks me up when I hear people call AI underwhelming," adding that he finds it "mindblowing" that anyone could be "unimpressed that we can have a fluent conversation with a super smart AI that can generate any image/video" and calling those lambasting Microsoft's push for AI "cynics."

I mean. I oscillate on this topic. From MIND BLOWN to Dammit I should talk to humans more.. I think though for 90+% of the population AI is just another techno tool that may or may not affect their lives. Or more bluntly too many product managers are shoving it into products no one asked for.
