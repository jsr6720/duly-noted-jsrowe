> Neo.mjs is a pioneering multi-threaded JavaScript framework that redefines web development. Leveraging an Off-Main-Thread (OMT) architecture, it delivers unparalleled performance and scalability for complex applications, enabling desktop-class multi-window experiences with advanced features like shared state and component persistence, and a zero-builds development workflow. 

I mean I feel like electron apps are a thing that weren't mentioned here? I get the push to move towards plain javascript and typescript objects again, But again feels like this glosses over huge eons of web Time when people had to target IE6 and IE11.. Those scars don't fade..
