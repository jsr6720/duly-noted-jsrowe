> Hiring of new grads by the 15 largest tech companies has fallen by more than 50% since 2019, according to a new report from VC firm SignalFire. While hiring for mid- and senior-level roles rebounded last year following mass layoffs across all levels in 2023, it declined at the entry level. The gap between the overall unemployment level and that of recent college grads recently reached an all-time high, according to census data.

I think one of the overlooked aspects here too is the accounting rule change that impacted the way software companies could capitialize salaries. No matter the cause, hiring for new SWE is tough right now.
