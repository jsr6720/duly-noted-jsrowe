> All AI assistants are required to identify themselves in commits using
Co-developed-by tags, ensuring full transparency about AI involvement in
code development.

ie 

```	Co-developed-by: Claude claude-opus-4-20250514```

I actually do like that this notes the model in use where as often it will just say Co-developed-by: Claude if you ask AI to annotate your commits.

I haven't quite gone all in on letting AI do my git actions..
