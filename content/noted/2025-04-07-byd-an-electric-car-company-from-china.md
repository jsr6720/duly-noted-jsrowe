> In late March, BYD surpassed Tesla TSLA in quarterly automotive revenue for the first time. This was no symbolic flourish, but an outright coup. This isn’t a case of catching up. It’s charging ahead. Buffett, meanwhile, recently reiterated his enthusiasm for BYD at Berkshire’s 2024 annual meeting: “Charlie [Munger] twice pounded the table … and said, ‘Buy BYD.’ He was right — big time.”

Ironically I learned about BYD while TikTok was banned and I explored Xioahongshu for a little while. I was aware that Ford CEO Jim Farely had indicated international competitors spooked him but the sleek designs and modern interiors and LOW cost of BYD vehicles is amazing. Coupled with apparently high quality and it will be interesting to see what happens to Ford/GM.
