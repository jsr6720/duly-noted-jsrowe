> On December 31st, I created the initial design.
> On January 1st, I shipped it.

here's the deal. even though this engineer built 35 react components in one day, what about the all the bugs that are going to come from that he generation of code?

Thats where the Jrs will shine. The same thing we always did. "hey there's this feature we wanted to get to" or "there's this low frequency bug we want you to look at".

I agree AI can do much more, but it can't do everything. Not now, not ever.
