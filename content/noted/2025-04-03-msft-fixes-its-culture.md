> Nadella had spent 22 years pulling himself up the ranks with his smarts and drive. And his likability. The latter trait was a rarity at the company. Nadella knew its culture intimately, and he knew he had to change it. ... But Nadella wrote a 10-page memo arguing that Microsoft’s revival would come from a growth mentality. As he later put it, he wanted to change the corporate personality from "know-it-all" to "learn-it-all".

Really too many anecdotes to do justice I put more details on my main site here <https://www.jsrowe.com/wired-the-big-tech-issue/>. The short version of the story is Nadella has made MSFT cool again by embracing developers, buying cool products (Minecraft) and being an interoperable tool for businesses.
