> Back in early 2020, about 11% of Amazon’s job postings were in offshore locations. Nothing unusual there.
> 
> But then something shifted. The percentage started climbing during the pandemic hiring boom and just… kept going. By 2023, it had hit 20%. Today? Nearly 28%.
> 
> Amazon has more than doubled the share of jobs that they plan to hire offshore in just five years. The % of job postings that are in offshored countries has increased 154% since 2020, to be exact (2.5x)

I know that globally poverty levels are down, but it's hard to not look at this math and think that the pie is growing AND more jobs are falling prey to remote global wage arbitrage. I'm not sure what hte answer is, but its nice to see some real data on the matter.
