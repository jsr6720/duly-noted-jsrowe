> Looking at the demand for misinformation tells us that as long as people have certain worldviews, they will seek out and find information consistent with those views. Depending on what someone’s worldview is, the information in question is often misinformation—or at least would be considered misinformation by those with differing worldviews.

AI as a technology doesn't spread disinformation. It does spread more rapidly in groups that are seeking validation. The danger is in the groups, not in the disinformation.
