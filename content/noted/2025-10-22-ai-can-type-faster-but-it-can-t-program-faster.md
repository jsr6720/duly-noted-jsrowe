> Do I program any faster? Not really. But it feels like Iâ€™ve gained 30% more time in my day because the machine is doing the work. I alternate between giving it instructions, reading a book, and reviewing the changes.

I think this is the way. and matches what I've experienced. Sure you can spool code from the CLI to your editor and review via git diffs. But are you accomplishing more throughput or just offloading syntaxual structure. I think more of AI as a mega-linter. Able to apply architectural patterns not just whitespace fixes.
