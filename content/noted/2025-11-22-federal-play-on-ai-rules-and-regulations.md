> The executive order, in the draft obtained by POLITICO, would also empower Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick to publish a review of “onerous” state AI laws within 90 days and restrict federal broadband funds to states whose AI laws are found to be objectionable. It would direct the Federal Trade Commission to investigate whether state AI laws that “require alterations to the truthful outputs of AI models” are blocked by the FTC Act.

The party of states rights everybody. But in all seriousness we should have national policy on things that affect all citizens... It just feels like instead of saying 'NO' we could say 'Here's the federal guidelines'.
