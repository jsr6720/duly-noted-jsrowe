> AI assistants optimize for making tests pass and errors disappear. Without clear direction, they’ll take the path of least resistance. Common shortcuts to watch for:
> 
> TypeScript any types appearing when proper typing gets complex
> Tests getting commented out or skipped when they’re hard to fix
> Quick fixes that address symptoms rather than root causes

Great write up on a using claude code cli. And this was in July before 3.5 sonnet! I found this list of 'gotchas' kinda funny because they're the exactly the kind of thing a senior engineer would catch immediately but a novice wielding AI might not. Fare not, "Refactoring and Debugging AI vibe apps" coming to a O'Reily publication near you. (To borrow a joke from his post)
