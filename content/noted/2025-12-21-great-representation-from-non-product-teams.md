> In the product environments Sean describes, where goals pivot quarterly and features are often experimental, speed is the ultimate currency. You need to ship, iterate, and often move on before the market shifts. But in Infrastructure and Developer Experience, context is the currency.

Agree 100% that for product facing teams. Being in the spotlight is to deliver what is desired. But for infra and platform. The last thing you want is to be in the spotlight. You want to be the scaffolding that supports the product.
