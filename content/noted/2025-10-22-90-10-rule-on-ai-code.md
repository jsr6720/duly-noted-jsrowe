> There are no weird files that shouldn’t belong there, no duplicate implementations, and no emojis all over the place. The comments still follow the style I want and, crucially, often aren’t there. I pay close attention to the fundamentals of system architecture, code layout, and database interaction. I’m incredibly opinionated. As a result, there are certain things I don’t let the AI do. I know it won’t reach the point where I could sign off on a commit. That’s why it’s not 100%.
> Research + code, instead of research and code later: Some things that would have taken me a day or two to figure out now take 10 to 15 minutes.
It allows me to directly play with one or two implementations of a problem. It moves me from abstract contemplation to hands on evaluation.

I think this is the coolest approach to AI. you get to research on YOUR code. no more trying to back match some stack overflow answer onto your own code.
