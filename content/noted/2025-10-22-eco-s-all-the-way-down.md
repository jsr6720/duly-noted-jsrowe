> Microsoft has increasingly given CEO titles to the leaders of some of its biggest businesses, such as Microsoft Gaming CEO Phil Spencer and Microsoft AI CEO Mustafa Suleyman. Microsoft also used CEO positions with its GitHub and LinkedIn acquisitions, although the GitHub CEO position disappeared after Thomas Dohmke resigned over the summer.

I wonder did the dutch India company have this problem? Everyone had to be a captain or some sort? Not dissing on the CEO title. just wondering out lout how big is too big.. I mean if companies are saying the quite part out loud "this is a separate company" why isn't it?
