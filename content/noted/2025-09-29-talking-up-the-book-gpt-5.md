> Companies building AI dev tools report positive results. Cursor calls it "the smartest coding model we've used." Windsurf says it has "half the tool calling error rate" of other models. Vercel praises its frontend capabilities.
> 
> Beyond the tool companies, some founders and developers have shared their early experiences. GitHub's CEO mentioned that GPT-5 shows promise for complex refactoring tasks. Several startup founders have noted improvements in code generation quality, though most emphasize they're still in early testing phases.
>
