> As token predictors, LLMs are certainly not “alive” or “intelligent”, and they never will be. We can argue about technical definitions of “life” and “intelligence” but those arguments usually lead nowhere because we really don’t have good definitions of those terms at this time.
> ...
> Even if machines could detect “better”, they certainly would not be able to detect better on your behalf. We humans can’t even detect better on behalf of other humans, which is why even in healthy, long-term relationships and friendships we still need to communicate about what we need and want.

Agreed on these points. the trade of of an all knowing AI is far worse than  booking your own dinner reservations.
