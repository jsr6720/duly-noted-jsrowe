> When we first launched this, I wrote maybe 5 percent of my code with Claude Code. And then in May, with Opus 4 and Sonnet 4, it became maybe like 30 percent. And now with Opus 4.5, 100 percent of my code for the last two months has been written by Claude Code. And I code every day.

I mean this tracks with my experience as well.
