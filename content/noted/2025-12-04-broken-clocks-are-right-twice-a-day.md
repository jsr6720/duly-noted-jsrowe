> ChatGPT, like many chatbots, is pitched as a hyper-competent personal assistant. But among the many things that confuse it, one is particularly confounding: It cannot tell time.

I mean LLMs weren't built to tell time? I think this is more proof that a real LLM/AI system will need to blend traditional application development with LLMs. Its why now when you ask an LLM a math problem it passes it off to python as a script to get your answer.
