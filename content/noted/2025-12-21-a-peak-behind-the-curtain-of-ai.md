> In some ways, it is the hype around large language models, not AI as a whole, that needs correcting. It has become obvious that LLMs are not the doorway to artificial general intelligence, or AGI, a hypothetical technology that some insist will one day be able to do any (cognitive) task a human can.

I think this is the sober take. It doesn't appear that LLM will bridge to AGI. And A *LOT* of speculation in the ai companies is based on this assumption it will displace labor costs. That doesn't look like its going to happen on a meaningful scale.
