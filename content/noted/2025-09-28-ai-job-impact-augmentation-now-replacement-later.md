> The swift advancement of artificial intelligence (AI) has sparked significant concern that this new technology will replace jobs and stifle hiring. ... Businesses reported a notable increase in AI use over the past year, yet very few firms reported AI-induced layoffs. Indeed, for those already employed, our results indicate AI is more likely to result in retraining than job loss ... Looking ahead, however, layoffs and reductions in hiring plans due to AI use are expected to increase, especially for workersÂ with a college degree.

Feels like a tale of two narratives. If you're currently employed, great you're expected to leverage technology to get more things done. I feel like this has always been the case? 

but if you're note employed. oof. It is a hard job market to enter right now. And this quote doesn't exactly fill me with confidence that layoffs and reductions are *expected to increase*.
