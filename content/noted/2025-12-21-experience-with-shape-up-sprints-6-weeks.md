> But our biggest struggle was that our projects were often smaller than the standard cycle size. We found ourselves trying to plan several smaller projects into a single 6-week cycle, effectively trying to run a planning two months ahead to fill the bucket which is more difficult and less reliable than in a shorter cadence. We lost the flexibility to reprioritize every two weeks, but we didn’t gain the benefit of deep, singular focus on one large feature. It also meant ‘fast-follows’ on projects to steer impact had to wait until the next cycle.

Love reading about real experience with different methodologies. It seems for this company it was more a matter of fit than practice? Besides haven't we all moved on to scrum-ban now..
