> Collapse does not mean you’re personally dying right now. It means y’all are dying right now. Death is sometimes close, sometimes far away, but always there. I used to judge those herds of gazelle when the lion eats one of them alive and everyone keeps going — but no, humans are just the same. That’s the real meaning of herd immunity. We’re fundamentally immune to giving a shit.

From someone who watched the collapse of Sri Lanka, ominous words of advice for Americans. Sometimes its really bizzare to read the news and head off on my day, but that's just it. Get busy living, or start dying.
