> Here is the ugly truth about "vibecoding":
> 
> It looks like magic when people show off simple tasks where the first prompt gets you 99% of the way there.
> But as soon as complexity increases, it falls apart. The AI fixes one bug and immediately breaks two others. Then it gets stuck in a loop trying to fix its own mess.
