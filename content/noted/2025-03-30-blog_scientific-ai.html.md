> The main mistake people usually make is thinking Newton or Einstein were just scaled-up good students, that a genius comes to life when you linearly extrapolate a top-10% student. This perspective misses the most crucial aspect of science: the skill to ask the right questions and to challenge even what one has learned.

Agreed. AI is a novel application of unstructured data, especially as it can surface existing data in large datasets faster than other research methods.

But, it's just that, a reflection of the data already collected. Buying more GPUs or compute is not going to scale an ok statistical regurgitation model into an AGI one.
