> I’m not the only person who’s bearish on Ruby. On Stack Overflow’s annual developer survey, it’s been slipping in popularity for years, going from a top-10 technology in 2013 to 18th this year—behind even Assembly. Among newer developers, Python and JavaScript rank much higher. Ruby persists, for now, as a kind of professional comfort object, sustained by the inertia of legacy code bases and the loyalty of those who first imprinted upon it. But nostalgia and a pretty name won’t cut it.

Really not sure why WIRED decided to ride in on their high horse and shit on ruby.
