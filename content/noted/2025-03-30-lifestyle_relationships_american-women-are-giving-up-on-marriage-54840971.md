> Marriage rates for both men and women are in decline, in part owing to less pressure to pair off and higher expectations for a would-be match. \“Dating apps make people feel like there might always be a better option,\” said Melissa Kearney, an economist at the University of Maryland. \“They view looking for a marriage partner the same way that you view looking for a job candidate.\”  

Seems to be a widening gap on education, family dynamics, and yes dating apps. Thought I'd start collecting notes on what I've read on this topic.
