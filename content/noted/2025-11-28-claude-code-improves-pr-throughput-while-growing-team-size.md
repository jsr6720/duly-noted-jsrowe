> But Anthropic saw a 67% increase in PR throughput as their team size doubled – thanks to Claude Code. It would have been normal for the average-PRs-merged metric to drop, but it actually went up! The credit for this is given to Claude Code: engineers get PRs done faster with it. In what might have been a lucky constellation of events, Anthropic doubled its engineering headcount at around the time that Claude Code was adopted across all of engineering.

Mostly the title. Generally adding more people slows down throughput. But Anthropic found that it could expand team size and increase throughput.
