> This context of AI’s limitations, the impossibility of industry-wide profitability, the gravy train of debt that is keeping this entire thing afloat starting to close, and Nvidia’s highly dependent and wildly undiversified revenue stream are utterly essential.
> This is a huge shame, because if they did, we would all see just how much of a hollow ruse this all is and how the AI industry is driving itself off a cliff at 150 mph, with the entire Western economy in the passenger seat. Mark my words, this earnings report isn’t the calm before the storm. It is the calm before the Category 5 hurricane.

A very long article to say essentially. It is a bubble, and it seems all of western companies are implicit in it.
