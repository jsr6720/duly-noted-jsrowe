> We found an average time savings of 5.4% of work hours in the November 2024 survey. For an individual working 40 hours per week, saving 5.4% of work hours implies a time savings of 2.2 hours per week. When we factor in all workers, including nonusers, workers saved 1.4% of total hours because of generative AI.

Note this is across all disciplines. Some tasks are more easily assisted by AI than others. But this outlines a broad trend of at least ~5% improvement across users.
