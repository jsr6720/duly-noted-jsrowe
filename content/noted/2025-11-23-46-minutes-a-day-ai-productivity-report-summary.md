> A three-month trial by the UK government of Microsoft 365 Copilot did not find any clear increase in productivity. And at a recent conference, the head of Microsoft's Modern Work and Business Applications division, Jared Spataro, admitted that "it is hard to make the ROI argument for it."

I think this might be because AI is REALLY good at something NO one did previously.. take notes..

> According to Lloyds Banking Group (LBG), the rollout is "helping teams summarize documents, prepare for meetings, and reduce administrative tasks." Almost 5,000 engineers are also using GitHub Copilot.

This also, 5k engineers using AI have replaced looking things up on stack overflow with AI. But typing out code is not the bottleneck. Building great solutions is.
