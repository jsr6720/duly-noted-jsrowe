> JPMorgan's president Daniel Pinto previously said implementing AI could add about $1 billion to $1.5 billion in value for the bank.

I think when compared to the market cap of JPMorganChase (654B) this absolute number ranks in at less than 2/10ths a percent. 

This article also seems focused on its Bengaluru, India operations which might have a very different experience with LLMs than American workers. No idea. The stated expected productivity improvement of 10%-20% is in line with other market research I've read.

Sadly I was unable to find an original cited source on this Reuters article.
