I can't quite make out why someone would bail out of a lucrative position because 'one day' it'll be gone? Disagree also on timeline, I've never met a non-FAANG organization that had a lack of projects to complete.

Storing this one away to see if his prediction comes true. 

> All in all, I think the evidence points to a scenario where by the end of this year or next, engineering and other pure knowledge work IC jobs can be mostly done by AI agents, with some fraction of the people who formerly held those IC jobs acting as de facto product managers cum infrastructure janitors for agent swarms.
> On one hand, this is great! We'll have essentially infinite working software at a price of â‰ˆ$0/line of code. The actual job of being an AI agent product manager cum infrastructure janitor, however, sounds awfully boring to me personally. That's why I quit my FAANG job a few weeks ago.
