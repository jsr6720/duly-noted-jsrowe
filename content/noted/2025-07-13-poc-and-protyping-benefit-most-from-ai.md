> Every couple of days a new article pops up about how engineers are X% more productive, and how company Y laid off hundreds of developers because they are not needed anymore. ... Also, if you are working on a completely fresh codebase, or on a PoC - the gains can be huge. I was able to build in the last 2 months something that would have taken me a year previously.

I think herein lies the best take. Make sure your team has access to the best tools, and the space to learn how best to apply them. They won't let  you down.
