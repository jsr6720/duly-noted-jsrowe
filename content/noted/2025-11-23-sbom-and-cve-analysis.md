> How to Evaluate Open Source Software
> The widespread use of open source software presents a unique set of challenges to software development because of its openness and distributed nature. Within the vast collection of projects in the open source ecosystem, many projects are well-maintained, secure, and up to date; however, there are also many projects that lack the human resources required to ensure they’re well managed.

There's very rarely a path to putting food on the table with open source.. Sadly.. So yea. no surprise here. Mostly 1 maintainer. Last seen 4 years ago.
