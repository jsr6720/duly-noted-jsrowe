> As we roll out more Generative AI and agents, it should change the way our work is done. We will need fewer people doing some of the jobs that are being done today, and more people doing other types of jobs. Itâ€™s hard to know exactly where this nets out over time, but in the next few years, we expect that this will reduce our total corporate workforce as we get efficiency gains from using AI extensively across the company.

Another day another AI prediciton by a CEO. This one coming from Amazon's CEO Andy Jassy. At this point it seems that all CEOs are both projecting adoption and utilizatin of AI but also not knowing exactly how much impact it will have long term. Does Amazon need 1.5 million employees? Andy thinks not.
