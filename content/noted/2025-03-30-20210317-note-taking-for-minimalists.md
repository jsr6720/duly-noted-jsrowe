> For example, does a light bulb really need to so smart that it is able to connect to the Internet? Does this little gain in comfort really outbalance the privacy risks related to it? Minimalistic use of technology does not mean we should avoid modern technology and go back to candle lightening. It is rather using the best and most efficient technology we totally master in its complexity. Applied to our example this would mean that we still prefer the most modern energy efficient LED light bulbs, but in this case we chose the not smart version.

Preach. Do one thing well.
