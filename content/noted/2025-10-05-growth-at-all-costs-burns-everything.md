> As my friend Kasey put it in a recent conversation, growth is a fire. If you build a nice, sustainable fire, it’ll keep you warm, cook food and sustain life. And if the only thing you care about is how big your fire is, then it’ll set fire to everything around it, and the more you throw into it, the more it’ll burn. Eventually, you’ll have nothing left, but if you desperately desire that fire, you will constantly have to find new things to burn at any cost.


One of the best posts that really captures my observations on the market. In a sane world companies would feel shame or be punished for laying off 3-5+% employees everywhere while also posting record profits. It certainly doesn't feel right when the company isn't on the line.
