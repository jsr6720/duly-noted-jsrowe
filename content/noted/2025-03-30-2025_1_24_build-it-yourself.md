> There are entire companies who are making a living of supplying you with the tools needed to deal with your dependency mess. In the name of security, we're pushed to having dependencies and keeping them up to date, despite most of those dependencies being the primary source of security problems.

In the world of `import left-pad` I too celebrate a denormalized central codebase. Not everything needs to be an import. I've seen both sides of this, wondering why my Hello World project has 20 node_modules but also working on large Enterprise Apps with thousands of packages, many duplicated.

There is also a buried point about having ChatGPT generate one-off packages, but I think the value of open source is truly that with enough eyes all bugs are shallow.
