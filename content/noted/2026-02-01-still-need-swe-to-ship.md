> AI coding agents can produce syntactically correct code. However, they don’t produce useful layers of abstraction nor meaningful modularization. They don’t value conciseness or improving organization in a large code base. We have automated coding, but not software engineering.

Ai can't even create syntactical correct code. This is the right approach. we've automated typing. That has implications on creating product features, but we still need software engineers.
