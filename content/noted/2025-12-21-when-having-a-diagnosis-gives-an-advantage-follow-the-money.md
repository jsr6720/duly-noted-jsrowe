> At Brown and Harvard, more than 20 percent of undergraduates are registered as disabled. At Amherst, that figure is 34 percent. Not all of those students receive accommodations, but researchers told me that most do. The schools that enroll the most academically successful students, in other words, also have the largest share of students with a disability that could prevent them from succeeding academically.

Pretty wild to me that elite institutions have a higher disability rate than the general population. This combined with WSJ coverage leads me to infer that parents are buying time literally for their kids. More time to complete the assignment correlates with higher grades
