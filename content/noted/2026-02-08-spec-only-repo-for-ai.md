> Recent advancements in coding agents are stunning. Opus 4.5 coupled with Claude Code isn’t perfect, but its ability to implement tightly specified code is uncanny. Models and their harnesses crossed a threshold in Q4, and everyone I know using Opus 4.5 has felt it. There wasn’t a single language where Claude couldn’t implement whenwords in one shot. These capabilities are raising all sorts of questions, especially: *“What does software engineering look like when coding is free?”*

Fascinating concept. but wouldn't generating a stable package version be better than constantly generating code? Remains to be seen.
