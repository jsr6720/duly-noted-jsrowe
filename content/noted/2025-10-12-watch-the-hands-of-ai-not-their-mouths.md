> Seven years from GPT-1 to the plateau. How many more until we stop trying to build intelligence and start trying to understand what we’ve already built? That’s the real work now - not training the next model, but figuring out what to do with the ones we have. Turns out the singularity looks less like transcendence and more like integration work. Endless, necessary integration work.

I think this is it. The last 5 years and especially 3 have been amazing to watch. From GPT-2 to today AI has only gotten better at helping me code basic things. But it still tries to run non-sensical commands and just recently added a "Utilties-2" folder to my project because I already had one?
