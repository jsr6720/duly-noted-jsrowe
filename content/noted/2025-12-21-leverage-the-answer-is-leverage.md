> Compensation and influence increase as you work your way up the derivative ladder because abstraction, fueled by financial and social capital, enables compound leverage. This model explains a possible not-too-distant future where the people who control the models are more powerful than the elected President.

Or maybe the domino effect? When you compete on skills the labor pool is large and the demand is elastic. However it seems there are very few positions or even people capable of running multi continental corporations. Hence their skill in this is compensated at the level to move markets.

But should CEO pay be 300x worker pay.. well thats a topic for another post
