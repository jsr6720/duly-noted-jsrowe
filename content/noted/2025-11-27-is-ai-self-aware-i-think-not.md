> We introduced AISAI, a quantitative framework for measuring self-awareness in LLMs through strategic differentiation. Our two key findings reshape understanding of AI self-awareness:
> Finding 1: Self-awareness is an emergent capability that appears in the majority of advanced
models but is absent in older/smaller models, representing a fundamental capability threshold
crossed with model advancement.
> Finding 2: Self-aware models exhibit a consistent rationality hierarchy—Self > Other AIs > Humans—with large AI attribution effects and moderate self-preferencing. Over half show
quick Nash convergence when told opponents are AIs, demonstrating both strategic mastery and
strong beliefs about AI rationality.

New index. haven't seen much new publication on this, so I guess not? Or as someone said once. train AI enough on the writings of science fiction and all AI feels sentient..
