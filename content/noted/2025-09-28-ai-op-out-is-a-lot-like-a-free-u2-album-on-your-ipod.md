> Microsoft and GitHub, not to mention rivals like Google, have gone all-in on a technology that a sizable or at least vocal portion of their customers simply don't want. And with billions in capital expenditures to recoup, they're making it difficult to avoid.
> 
> During Microsoft's July 30, 2025 earnings call, CEO Satya Nadella said GitHub Copilot continued to exhibit strong momentum and had reached 20 million users.

I mean 1. MSFT just flat out bought its way into the space between GitHub and VSCode (which Cursor is a fork of) and 2. its really easy to say you've reached 20 million users when its in your face in every single app.

I have my gripes but mostly because GitHub copilot is a first class citizen in GitHub.com and all other integrations are `[bot]`...
