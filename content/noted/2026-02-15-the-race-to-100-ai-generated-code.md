> Still, outside the leading AI labs, the figures for AI-generated code reported by many software companies is significantly lower. For instance, Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella said in April 2025 that AI was generating about 30% of code at the software giant. Salesforce has given out a similar figure. A study published in the journal Science earlier this month looked at GitHub Python functions and found that about 29% in the U.S. are now AI-written, with lower percentages in other geographies.

I think it's probably trivial to use AI to generate and re-generate all of your code. 

As the saying goes. not everything you measure matters and not everything you can measure translates to impact.
