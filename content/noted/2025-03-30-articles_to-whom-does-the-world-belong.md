> Some commentators have made a habit of mocking the quality of AI outputs, insisting their capabilities are vastly overstated. This may be true, but when it shades into the contention that AIs will only ever produce \“slop\”—and that they will never compete with human creators—it begins to seem like a form of willful denial. AIs do not outcompete experienced humans in many domains today; they may not do so tomorrow. But that is not the bar for their political and economic significance. They need not reach this standard in order to generate products that huge numbers of people find genuinely useful and valuable. They do so already.
