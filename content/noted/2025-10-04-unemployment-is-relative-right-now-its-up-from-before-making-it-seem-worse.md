> This 1.34 percentage point increase represents more than just a statistical noise; it reflects a significant shift in how the economy is absorbing newly educated workers. The magnitude of this change becomes even more striking when compared with that of other demographic groups. Noncollege-educated workers in the same age range have seen only a modest 0.47 percentage point increase in unemployment, while older college graduates have experienced a 0.38 percentage point rise.


Not sure if companies are holding their breath because of AI or tariffs or interest rates or yea just the uncertainty. But it's been brutal out there. Having graduated into the 2008 crises I can relate.
