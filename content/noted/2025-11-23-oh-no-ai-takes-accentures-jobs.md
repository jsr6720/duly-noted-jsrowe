> DUBLIN, Oct 24 (Reuters Breakingviews) - Management consultants are getting closer to their Kodak moment. The likes of $155 billion Accenture (ACN.N), opens new tab made their mark by charging corporate clients way less than what they would have had to pay to provide IT, cyber protection and offshore call centres themselves. Artificial intelligence is making the $1 trillion, opens new tab industry’s dynamics look problematically like that of the camera giant that famously filed for bankruptcy protection in 2012 - after having its lunch eaten by digital competition.

I'm not sure if this is a Kodak moment, as much as it is a tool evolution moment. But for sure ask AI to give you a SWOT analysis or high-level competitor analysis and it does an ok job.

I cry not for the consultant class..
