> But thereâ€™s no fun anymore. The stores just feel really kind of dingy, unkempt, with stuff locked behind doors.

Not much of a shopper, but Target really felt like a fun place to shop with great deals and clean stores. The answer seems so obvious to me, hire. more. people. Check outs and returns routinely take 20-30 min, the self checkout lanes are so slow and the lines long. My frequent impulse buys of Legos or Switch Games for the kids are locked up, not even able to browse. And even the socks and underwear require a person to unlock. A last straw, it seems like the in-store Starbucks are after thoughts. Sorry Target, Runnings and Tractor Supply have my dollars now. Glad to know it isn't just me.
