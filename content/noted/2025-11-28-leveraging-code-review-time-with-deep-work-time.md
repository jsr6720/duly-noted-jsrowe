> Moderne founder and CTO Olga Kundzich argues that the term “parallel coding” is a misnomer, as AI-assisted coding is never truly autonomous in the first place. “Working with coding agents requires developers to spend time upfront designing the solution together with the agent – planning – and then periodically answering questions from the agents to guide them forward, as well as examining their work at the end,” says Kundzich, whose company offers a platform for automated code refactoring and analysis. “A developer can manage a couple of parallel sessions at most.”

I think this is the right take. Deep work paired with fast runs on tangental work.
