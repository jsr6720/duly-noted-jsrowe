> Ford still plans to produce a midsize electric pickup truck with a target starting price of about $30,000, to be available in 2027. 

I believe it when I see it. I bought a wait list ticket for the F150 lightening. The 40k price was no where to be found. The cheapest I could find it was 80k. Ridiculous.
