> “As well as the licensing and cost concerns, I am also wondering how an organization manages these agents,” he added. “If they can join meeting and send emails/messages to people – what happens if they go rogue? It could be sending sensitive data to the wrong people, providing incorrect information, or it could be sending strange or offensive messages…how is that to be prevented, monitored, and acted upon?”

Sounds like a lethal trifecta problem.. 

Always reminded of that joke about technologist who have a brother printer and a gun in the drawer in case it decides to act up..

Intersting note on the "Agent 365" or "A365" lic requirement (?)
