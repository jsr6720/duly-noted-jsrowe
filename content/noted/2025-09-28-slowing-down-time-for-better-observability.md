> Making Postgres 42,000x slower because I am unemployed

I mean. It's why this project exists. I wanted to learn about AWS lambda, s3 and GitHub actions. Plus Hugo. So I get it. And there's utility in understanding how things work, always.

If you can slow it down 42,000x just think about how happy your users will be when you speed it back up.
