> As well as being our most capable model, Claude Sonnet 4.5 is our most aligned frontier model yet. Claude’s improved capabilities and our extensive safety training have allowed us to substantially improve the model’s behavior, reducing concerning behaviors like sycophancy, deception, power-seeking, and the tendency to encourage delusional thinking. For the model’s agentic and computer use capabilities, we’ve also made considerable progress on defending against prompt injection attacks, one of the most serious risks for users of these capabilities.

I mean I was all in on Claude Code but it kept making md files for everything. I've been using Codex recently. but in the grand scheme of things it *feels* like anthropic is structured ethically.

but who am I kidding. there are billions of dollars at stake. No room for ethics..
