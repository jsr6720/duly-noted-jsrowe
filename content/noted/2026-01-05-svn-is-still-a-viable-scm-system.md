> SVN’s locking model, when properly used, surfaces this problem immediately: “Why is Sarah working on the authentication module when you’re working on authentication?” It forces the conversation upfront rather than leaving you to discover the problem in code review – if you catch it at all.

I started on SVN so it's near and dear my heart. And there's two things I think SVN does better. 1. you have to be at latest to merge and 2. you can't lose things to git rewrites, merge commits or forced rewrites

Tbh at the small shop I started at (~3 developers) SVN worked just fine. 

Also kudos to this guy, he has the exact same  template I picked for <txcowboycoder.wordpress.com>
