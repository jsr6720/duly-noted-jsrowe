> Along the way I have developed a programming philosophy I now apply to everything: the best software for an agent is whatever is best for a programmer. The practical nature of writing software for customers has traditionally pushed us away from that philosophy. Product Managers have long had to find gentle ways to tell engineers: you are not the customer. Well, that has all been turned on its head. Every customer has an agent that will write code against your product for them. Build what programmers love and everyone will follow.
