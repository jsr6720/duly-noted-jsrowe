> Called J.P. Morgan Private Client, it is anchored by the new physical locations, of which there will be 31 by the end of next year. The service comes with its own mobile banking app, but its main appeal is the in-person experience: Instead of being handed off to multiple employees like at a Chase branch, J.P. Morgan Private Client members are assigned to a single banker.

I think this is the ultimate outcome of services in an economy of bots. A dedicated human touch. we are human after all, I think.
