> Meta devised an ingenious system (“localhost tracking”) that bypassed Android’s sandbox protections to identify you while browsing on your mobile phone — even if you used a VPN, the browser’s incognito mode, and refused or deleted cookies in every session.

Worth the entire read, but whats fascinating is that some engineer was given a problem of how to track users across apps and sessions and didn't blink an eye at solving it. Further proving that technology is a tool, and we can abosolutely hold companies accountable for violating ethics, morals and most importantly regulations. This post is very tech heavy which is great, but the crux is, meta could figure out who you were on andorid devices even if you never logged into their services. No good.
