> React is the Walmart of JavaScript frameworks. It’s everywhere, it’s massive, it’s not particularly elegant, but it gets the job done. Meta’s baby has grown into an absolute unit, dominating job listings, GitHub stars, and the collective anxiety of junior developers trying to understand why useEffect fired seventeen times when they only wanted it to run once.

OGs remember Ember vs knockout, prototype.js vs scriptaculous.. jQuery.. Yahoo UI! 

I think at this point react is settling in as the java jdk of the web. Good enough for most but pales in comparison to Wordpress..
