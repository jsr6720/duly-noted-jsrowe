The biggest change for me is that I can wake up in the morning, take my three or four tasks for the day, start 3 different sessions of Claude Code, and then spend some time writing a good prompt for each.

Execute in plan mode, review the plan, and then Claude chunks out near perfect implementations each time. That's about my first 30-45 mins of the day. I'll then spend an hour or two verifying/testing and then deploying the changes.

Lately, those 3-4 tasks would have probably each taken me a day or more - so by noon each day I feel like I've accomplished a lot. I'll usually go read and start thinking about my tasks that I want to do the next day, and then repeat.

So for me, I spend a lot less time at the keyboard, because 99% of the coding/implementation is now done for me, which also used to be the most time consuming task.

I have time to think through problems in the afternoon and night and usually wake up with a good idea of how to specify it to Claude. Sometimes at night I'll use the Claude App on my phone to talk through ideas on what I'm thinking. Contrary to what a lot of people think, my Claude does push back against ideas, tells me when I'm not thinking about things the right way, etc. It's become like my always on co-worker. It's been truly life changing for me as I can focus on solving problems rather than implementing solutions to problems.

I'm working on a piece on how I work with AI coming soon to my main site.
