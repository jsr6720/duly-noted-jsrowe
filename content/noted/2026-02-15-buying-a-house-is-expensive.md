>  Home values have risen much faster than the incomes of the people living in them. From 2000 to 2024, median per-capita income has grown steadily but modestly, at around 155% in nominal terms. Over the same period, median home prices—when measured carefully and adjusted for local composition—have increased at a much faster pace, at around 207% in nominal terms.

> For first-time homebuyers, the bar for homeownership is now substantially higher, and this is why the average age to purchase a first house has increased around 10 years. For existing owners, housing has become an increasingly central store of wealth.
