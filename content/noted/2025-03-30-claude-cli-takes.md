> It's like a wood chipper fueled by dollars. It can power through shockingly impressive tasks, using nothing but chat. You don't even select context. You just open your heart and your wallet, and Claude Code takes the wheel. It even helps keep you in the loop by prompting you every eight seconds to ask if it can use basic read-only commands that you would allow _anyone_, even North Korean hackers, to run on your machine.

Kinda terrifying to use Claude CLI and have no idea of expense. I've found that greenfield code is measured in pennies, and edits/modifications in dimes or mabye a quarter. I have no idea the token to problem solving ratio, but as Steve put's it so eloqently; Open your heart and your wallet and feed those problems to a wood chipper!
