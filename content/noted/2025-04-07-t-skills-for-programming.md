> Software gets more complicated. All of this complexity is there for a reason. But what happened to specializing? When a house is being built, tons of people are involved: architects, civil engineers, plumbers, electricians, bricklayers, interior designers, roofers, surveyors, pavers, you name it. You donâ€™t expect a single person, or even a whole single company, to be able to do all of those.

I mean, this is the business of software engineering. Work gets compressed to whom ever can generate the most revenue per employee.
