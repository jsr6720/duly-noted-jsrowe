> Inception Point’s ability to flood the market with audio episodes faster than any human team could match starkly illustrates both the promise of AI and the nightmare scenario that it can truly come after every job. Even as companies have shed more than a million jobs this year, with many citing AI as a reason, there was a belief that certain creative roles would be safe.

I think what people need to realize is that if the ROI is at 20 streams, filling the void with nonsense can be profitable. Given the prevalence of the dead internet theory I just wonder how many companies are paying to run ads on these peusdo casts.
