> But Anthropic’s growth path is a lot easier to understand than OpenAI’s. Corporate customers are devising a plethora of money-saving uses for AI in areas like coding, drafting legal documents and expediting billing. Those uses are likely to expand in the future and draw more customers to Anthropic, especially as the return on investment for them becomes easier to measure.

Writing down my own personal prediction.. Sam Altman and OpenAI is more like Newman and WeWork. OpenAI is the lightning rod attracting all the lawsuits and frankly asserting that you need trillions to build data centers isn't a great return on investment.

Pushing ads into ChatGPT is the no-brainer but that will lead to enshitification as google search has proven.

Contrast that with Anthropic. Building tools for paying business customers. First move market advantage is mostly a myth anyways. Will be interesting to watch.
