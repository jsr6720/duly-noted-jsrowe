> The percentage of young Gen Z employees between the ages of 21 and 25 has been cut in half at technology companies over the past two years, according to recent data from compensation management software business Pave

Article indicates that average age of tech companies has risen by ~5 years and also that % of workforce under 25 has shrank. will see how things shake out. I have to admit I wonder how much of the "we don't need 'old' people" crowd has changed their tune since they are now the old people (in tech).

> Meanwhile, the average age of a worker at a tech company has risen dramatically over those two and a half years. Between January 2023 and July 2025, the average age of all employees at large public technology businesses rose from 34.3 years to 39.4 yearsâ€”more than a five year difference.

Many big tech companies are nearly 30!
