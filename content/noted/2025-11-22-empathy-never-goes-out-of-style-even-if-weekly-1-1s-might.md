> The conclusion here is clear: the industry will want different things from you as it evolves, and it will tell you that each of those shifts is because of some complex moral change, but it’s pretty much always about business realities changing. If you take any current morality tale as true, then you’re setting yourself up to be severely out of position when the industry shifts again in a few years, because “good leadership” is just a fad.

I really struggled reading this. because part of my own journey into management was driven by a desire to replace non-technical managers who met with me once a year to an engineering leader from the front lines. But sigh. I should know that even leading with empathy would be a fad.

when money is cheap you have time for luxuries. When money is expensive suddenly 1:20 or even 1:30 manager:employee ratios feels rationale.
