If imitation is the sincerest form of flattery, this project really aims to capture Simon's "Quoted" posts like this one <https://simonwillison.net/2025/Feb/19/matt-webb/>.

Of course in the time its taken me to whittle away at this Simon added his own 'notes' to his main site. <https://simonwillison.net/2025/Mar/26/notes/>
