> This insight reframes recent labor market debates. The rise in vacancies since the mid-2010s, and especially after the pandemic, reflects a growing focus on poaching rather than a general shortage of labor. Aggregate vacancy measures, which mix these two motives, have become a noisy and potentially misleading signal.

Wow! TIL about the Beveridge Curve in economics! And looking at this chart it was cyclical until the boom of 2010 and produced another K shaped chart! not clear yet if this signal is divorced from reality or if it will fall back into a cyclical pattern. Very cool.
