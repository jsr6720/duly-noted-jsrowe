> Programming, at its essence, is conversation with computers. It’s how we translate human intention into machine action. Throughout computing history, we’ve continuously built better translation layers between human thought and machine execution—from physical wiring to assembly language to high-level languages to the World Wide Web, which embedded calls to backend systems into a frontend made up of human-readable documents. LLMs are simply the next evolution in this conversation, making access to computer power more natural and accessible than ever before.

I strongly agree with this sentiment. We all grew up watching star trek and its ability converse with the computer. Yet, real flesh and blood, and some cyborgs, ran the ship. Here's to the final frontier.
