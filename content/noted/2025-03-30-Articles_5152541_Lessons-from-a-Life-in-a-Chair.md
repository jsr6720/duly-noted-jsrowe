> In the end, the language ends up the overweight middle aged guy in a speedo. It's kind of bloated, too complex, too diffuse, trying to be too many things to too many people. It's become what it in some cases may have even been created in opposition to, something often true in the wider world in general. It leaves me sort of hoping for a punk revolution sometimes.

Fun read from someone with 40 years of experience on lessons learned from programming. I especially liked this quote on languages moving into middle age.
