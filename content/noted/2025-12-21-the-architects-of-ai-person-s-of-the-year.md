> These new tools can feel like magic. In the past few weeks alone, we’ve learned that AI could facilitate communication with whales, solve an unsolved 30-year-old math problem, and outperform traditional hurricane-prediction models. These systems are improving at a blistering pace, taking seconds to perform work that once took people hours. AI’s capabilities double nearly twice a year now, according to one study. The speed of adoption has been without precedent. “Every industry needs it, every company uses it, and every nation needs to build it,” Jensen Huang, who leads Nvidia, the world’s most valuable company and one of the world’s most influential AI leaders, tells TIME. “This is the single most impactful technology of our time.”

Remember when Time used to pick ONE person for person of the year. But I digress some of these accomplishments are looking great. I notice "generate AI gooner material" didn't make the list. /s
