> I told myself I just needed to build more. The next feature would be the one.

I really applaud Austin Starks for being so open and transparent about his pursuit of a profitable project. And I think like a lot of engineers convinced that 'just one more feature' would be the viral sensation. 

While the product does generate revenue, it seems Austin is back at a w2 job. Congrats Austin, thanks for sharing your journey with us.
