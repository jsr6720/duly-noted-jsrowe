> More than three quarters (77%) of companies’ usage of Anthropic’s Claude AI software involved automation patterns, often including “full task delegation,” according to a research report the startup released on Monday. The finding was based on an analysis of traffic from Anthropic’s application programming interface, which is used by developers and businesses.

I think the critical thought here is maybe users are only leaning into AI where it makes sense now? So I would expect more of anthropic usage patterns to reflect actual work instead of exploratory work 2 years in.
