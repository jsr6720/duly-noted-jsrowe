> Recent data shows that companies are increasingly relying on debt, rather than real revenue and cashflow to fund commitments to OpenAI and vice-versa. OpenAI has made a truly staggering $1.4 trillion (with a T) in commitments for compute to meet its projected needs, despite posting a "paltry" $20 billion in revenues this annum. To put it into context, $20 billion represents just 1.43~% of that $1.4 trillion commitment. It's a truly insane gap.

My personal hot take. MSFT and other OpenAI partners are just going to use that company to learn how to build LLM models and it will tank. it has attracted the most lawsuits and the least amount of business dollars..
