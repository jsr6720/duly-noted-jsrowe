> As software engineers we don’t just crank out code—in fact these days you could argue that’s what the LLMs are for. We need to deliver code that works—and we need to include proof that it works as well. Not doing that directly shifts the burden of the actual work to whoever is expected to review our code.

I love how simply stated this is. Which is probably why it's making the rounds on the inter webs. AI doesn't deliver code proven to work. It generates code that might work. Its still *someones* job to prove it works.
