> The first thing I noticed is that LLM-powered autocomplete was wildly accurate. It seemed like it "knew" what I wanted to do next at every turn. Due to my discomfort with AI, I just stuck with autocomplete for a while. And, honestly, if I stuck with just using autocomplete it would still have been a massive level up.
