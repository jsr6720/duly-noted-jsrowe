> I don’t know which direction we’re going in with AI (well, ~80% of us; to the remaining holdouts, I salute you and wish you godspeed!), but I do think it’s a future where we prize instant answers over teaching and understanding. There’s less reason to use something like blob-util, which means there’s less reason to write it in the first place, and therefore less reason to educate people about the problem space.

Know whats' faster than having AI generate it. Importing it.

having just done this with a simple 'replacement' of `rtCamp/action-slack-notify` I can assure you no time was saved setting it up for internal use over just importing it.

Now for tiny functions like `left-pad` yea I can see the threshold of utility publishing (floor) being raised.
