> A real-estate lawyer might have provided a better analysis, I thought—but not in three minutes, or for two hundred bucks. (The A.I.’s analysis included a few errors—for example, it initially overestimated the size of the property—but it quickly and thoroughly corrected them when I pointed them out.)

There's a lot going on in this article, but the point is that ChatGPT and its ilk can summon up whatever you guide it to answer. Whether or not this is actionable I don't think should be compared to relative value, but perceived expertise. To rely on LLM on the question of whether or not to sell a home feels foolish to me. Regardless AI is here to stay.
