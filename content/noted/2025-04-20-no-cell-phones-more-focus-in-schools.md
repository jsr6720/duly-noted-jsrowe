> A report by scientists and experts commissioned by the French president, Emmanuel Macron, last year concluded that children should not be allowed to use smartphones until they were 13 and should be banned from accessing conventional social media such as TikTok, Instagram and Snapchat until they were 18. No child should have a phone before age 11, the report said, and they should only have a handset without access to the internet before 13.

Nice to see some research out there establishing that schools are better without cell phones.
