> When your prompts involve multiple components like context, instructions, and examples, XML tags can be a game-changer. They help Claude parse your prompts more accurately, leading to higher-quality outputs.

Dying after years of REST/JSON is better than SOAP and here we are.. XML all over again. I also find it funny that the fully unstructured LLM prompt reader is like 'actually if you *explicitly* tell me what you want I work better'. 

I wonder if this will lead to something like domain specific languages. We could call it DSL for short /s.
