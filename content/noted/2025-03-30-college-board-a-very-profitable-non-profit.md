> The College Board writes the curriculum for 40 AP courses, administers and grades the exams, oversees the PSAT and SAT, and offers a variety of free and paid resources to help prepare for the courses and tests. Many students will wind up paying the company north of $1,000 over the course of their high school career.

Thats $1k per student... I do struggle to understand how we let a private company grab the bridge between primary and secondary education but here we are. It certainly seems like the more money you have the better you do on these tests. Not exactly the meritocracy a public education is supposed to deliver.
