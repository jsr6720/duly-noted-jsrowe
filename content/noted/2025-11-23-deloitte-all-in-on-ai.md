> The partnership comes at an embarrassing time for Deloitte, after it paid back a partial refund of $440,000 Australian dollars ($290,000 USD) to the federal government after a report was found to be strewn with errors that it admitted had been produced with the assistance of AI, specifically OpenAI’s GPT-4o via Microsoft Azure’s AI Foundry platform.
> 
> The errors included a fabricated quote from a federal court judgment and references to nonexistent academic research papers.
