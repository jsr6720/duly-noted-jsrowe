“Vibe coding refers to a method of coding with AI where you kind of close your eyes and you don’t look at the code at all and you just ask the AI to go build the thing for you,” he said.
Truell likened it to building a house by putting up four walls and a roof without knowing what’s going on under the floorboards or with the wiring.
This coding method may be perfect for AI users looking to quickly mock up a game or website, but when it comes to more advanced programming, things have the potential to go wrong, he warned.
“If you close your eyes and you don’t look at the code and you have AIs build things with shaky foundations as you add another floor, and another floor, and another floor, and another floor, things start to kind of crumble,” he said. 
```

I get this sentiment, but then I don't understand why cursor is going for the 'agent' mode now in its newer updates. I want to be able to see the code not just the ai panel.

I think the point about laying on unsure foundations its the key point.
