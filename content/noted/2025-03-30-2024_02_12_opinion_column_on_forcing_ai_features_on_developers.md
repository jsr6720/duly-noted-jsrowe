> The introduction of a non-removable AI Assistant plug-in into the daily working lives of developers is such a bad idea

Certainly feels like so much of AI is opt-out and not opt-in just to drive engagement numbers. Building software takes enough focus, completely changing the IDE experience seems like a speed bump not an on-ramp.

Bonus points for learning the word 'quiescent'. Nice.
