I think the big story here is their interpretation of people using AI to automate is surpassing augmentation. Which would imply more adoption has gone from trail+explore to real solutions?

> At a high level, we distinguish between automation and augmentation modes of using Claude:
> 
> Automation encompasses interaction patterns focused on task completion:
> 
> Directive: Users give Claude a task and it completes it with minimal back-and-forth
> Feedback Loops: Users automate tasks and provide feedback to Claude as needed
> Augmentation focuses on collaborative interaction patterns:
> 
> Learning: Users ask Claude for information or explanations about various topics
> Task Iteration: Users iterate on tasks collaboratively with Claude
> Validation: Users ask Claude for feedback on their work
