> “I look at how complex the training recipes are and how manual AI training and development is today, and there’s no way this is going to take us all the way to AGI just by itself,” Ng said.

> “When someone uses AI and the system knows some language, it took much more work to prepare the data, to train the AI, to learn that one set of things than is widely appreciated,” he added.

This is the take. There is so much human effort that goes into make an LLM useful it feels hard to assume that there will be no human workers in the future.

> Many experts have recently asserted that coding is the “epicenter of AI progress” and that AI’s shocking capabilities only become apparent when people use AI tools to code. Those developments have led some to theorize that traditional coding-only jobs will wither with the rise of AI, and early evidence backs up those claims.
