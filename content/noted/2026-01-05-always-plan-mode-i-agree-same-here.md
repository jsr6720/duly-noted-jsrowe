> Identify which tasks are not appropriate for claude: lots of domain knowledge required, very quick changes (where change, commit and push take less time than claude needs to gather context and make changes), business-logic or domain-related bugs/problems, bugs that I know will require a lot of live debugging (claude is slow at this if it even manages it). I'll usually do these manually while I have claude running on other tasks, so I'm working in parallel.
> ALWAYS plan mode and ALWAYS review it before starting. Doesn't take long and catches design issues in their infancy.

Another strong post on how a person uses ai to build software
