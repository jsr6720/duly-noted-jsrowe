> For me, this was one of those ‘future shock’ moments when you realise the world has moved on. When I got started in computers, you had to do low-level bit twiddling to get anything very interesting done, so you pretty much couldn’t avoid learning about XOR. But these days, to a high-level programmer, it’s much more of an optional thing, and you can perfectly well not know much about it.

I have seen `XOR` exactly once in my career and it confused me. I admit that most of this post I will forget, the time it took to write is appreciated.
