> As an example, Huang pointed to radiologists, who he says are now “more efficient” workers thanks to AI, processing more scans than ever before. (In reality, increased workloads are likely the result of a massive shortage of trained radiologists in the US, the kind of crisis which privately owned AI companies hope will bring immense profits.)

Would agree that labor market conditions have much more to do with supply/demand of labor rather than automation. But the point here from Nvidia is that when AI can generate infinite outputs suddenly your job is much harder in having to validate which have merit.
