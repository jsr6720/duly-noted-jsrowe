LLMs are engineering marvels, and I have the utmost respect for the people who’ve created them. But we still need to build software, not productionize prototypes.

Seriously what is with AI and lacing it with emojis. no one is THAT happy writing code. I think the point here is still. Own the solution. Don't just generate code, be the better person and understand what it's doing.


The generating new functions inline when classes have it elsewhere is also a big pet peeve of mine.
