> Ginsparg was frustrated because he couldn’t understand why implementing features that used to take him a day now took weeks. I challenged him on this, asking if there was any documentation for developers to onboard the new code base. Ginsparg responded, “I learned Fortran in the 1960s, and real programmers didn’t document,” which nearly sent me, a coder, into cardiac arrest.

Interview with the creator of arXiv which I've learned is pronouced 'archive'. I've read so many good papers on this site and none are paywalled. This quote about Ginsparg happily wirting code without documentation especially pleased me. Why not? It works doesnt it?
