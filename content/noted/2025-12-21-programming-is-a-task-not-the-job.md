> This is what I keep coming back to when I see another “Programming is dead” post go viral. The companies building AI, the ones who supposedly know exactly what it can and can’t do, are spending billions to acquire engineering talent. Not fire them, acquire them.
> Here’s my take: AI can replace most of programming, but programming isn’t the job.
> Programming is a task. It’s one of many things you do as part of your work. But if you’re a software engineer, your actual job is more than typing code into an editor.

This guy gets it. if AI was coming for programming they wouldnt' be hiring engineers. They'd just turn their AI systems inward.

> OpenAI and Anthropic could build their own tools. They have the best AI in the world. Instead, they’re spending billions on engineers. That should tell you something.
