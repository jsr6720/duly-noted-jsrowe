> Large language models are trained to continue patterns in ways that sound right to humans. They are optimized to produce answers, not to stop and say “I don’t know.” That incentive structure matters. When a model fills gaps, it does so confidently, because confidence reads as usefulness.
> Treat AI output as a proposal, not an answer.
