> Google has eliminated more than one-third of its managers overseeing small teams, an executive told employees last week, as the company continues its focus on efficiencies across the organization.
> 
> “Right now, we have 35% fewer managers, with fewer direct reports” than at this time a year ago, said Brian Welle, vice president of people analytics and performance, according to audio of an all-hands meeting reviewed by CNBC.

This from the same company that thought it could just have CEOs all the way down and I guess many of these impacted roles were managing fewer than three people. I suppose this does dovetail with their own research they frequently publish at <https://rework.withgoogle.com/intl/en/>
