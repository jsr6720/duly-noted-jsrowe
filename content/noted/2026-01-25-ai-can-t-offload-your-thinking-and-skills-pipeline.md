> And here’s what gets me: AI can only look backwards. It’s trained on what already exists. The institution’s ability to evolve depends on humans doing the hard intellectual work of figuring out what doesn’t exist yet. New patterns, new approaches, new understanding in response to changing circumstances. When that atrophies, the institution ossifies.

It think the only counterpoint I have is that AI will often help you get unstuck if you use it as an inspection tool.
