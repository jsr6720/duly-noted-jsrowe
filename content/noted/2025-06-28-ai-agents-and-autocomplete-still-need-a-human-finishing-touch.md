> Dohmke [GitHub CEO] described an effective workflow where AI tools generate code and submit pull requests. Developers can make immediate adjustments using their programming skills.

Matches my experience as well. A silly example. I ask AI to add padding to a div and it adds a `style` inline tag. Not a `pt-3` class. AI has been great for getting 80% started. The rest is still up to us.
