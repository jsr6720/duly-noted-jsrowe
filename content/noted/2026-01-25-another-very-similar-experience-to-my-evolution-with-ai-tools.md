> We’re in the midst of a paradigm shift. I implore you to stop thinking in terms of the old paradigm. Embrace AI fully to drastically augment your own capabilities. Make AI your collaborator; make it your co-worker. AI will happily do the work, you just have to tell it where to focus its efforts. Working with AI requires you to take on additional roles. So be a Team Lead. Be a Manager. Be a Director. Be an Orchestrator.
