> Deep learning may transform health care, but model development has largely been dependent on availability of advanced technical expertise. Herein we present the development of a deep learning model by clinicians without coding, which predicts reported sex from retinal fundus photographs.

this is the kind of news I want to read. But knowing AI I wonder if it just figured out that one group was in a folder labeled "men" and another "women". But regardless the biomarkers approach is cool!
