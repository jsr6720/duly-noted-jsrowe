> Yegge argues that the current developer workflow, heavily reliant on manual coding within an IDE, is fundamentally outdated in an age of rapidly advancing artificial intelligence. He posits that the tools developers cling to, while familiar, are akin to using a typewriter when sophisticated word processors are available. This resistance to adopting powerful AI-native tools, he contends, creates a significant productivity gap, leaving countless engineering hours on the table. The industry’s comfort with established practices, coupled with a lack of awareness regarding AI’s true capabilities, prevents a necessary evolution.

The prediction that IDE will be gone in 2026 is pure fiction. You STILL have to review the code. AI Sucks at deleting things and what about .env files or configs or terminal?
