> In the world of chat-oriented programming, understanding a codebase is more akin to having a robotic travel guide who can not only guide you through the forest, but highlight points of interest, explain the local fauna, and speed-run the trails to help you find the quickest path. To bring it back to coding, your AI coding assistant can summarize modules, explain obscure functions, and provide clear and concise answers to your questions. Instead of digging through a directory, you simply ask your questions in natural language, and the AI coding assistant goes and finds all the relevant files for that query, uses those files as context, and gives you a tailored answer then and there.

even in thought works tech radar they describe navigating code bases with AI as trial/adopt. This in my opinion is the most valuable part of AI> "just where is X happening" in a thousand file repo is very helpful.
