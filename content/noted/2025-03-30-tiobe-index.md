> TIOBE index top 20. Fortran and Delphi are competing for a top 10 position

Another use case of my Duly Noted site. I've been following TIOBE for a while now, and the web archive is nice, but what about what I think?

Python skyrocketing to the top is not much a surprise. I think C has dominated this list since I was in school...
