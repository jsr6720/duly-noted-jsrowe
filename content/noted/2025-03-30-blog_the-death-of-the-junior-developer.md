I do agree that there is tremendous pressure on entry positions, but I think this is more an artifact of macro economic forces pressing down on the labor pool pushing sr's into jr roles. And jrs. off the map.

I am not a horror film fan at all so the references were all lost on me, but in short with great technology change comes adaption or death. I guess.
