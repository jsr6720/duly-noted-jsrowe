> Long-term maintainability: This is the most insidious impact radius because it has the longest feedback loop, these issues might only be caught weeks and months later. These are the types of cases where the code will work fine for now, but will be harder to change in the future. Unfortunately, it’s also the category where my 20+ years of programming experience mattered the most.

Article covering all the ways an expert engineering had to guide AI, out of pitfalls, away from landmines and most importantly towards a long-term sustainable architecture. If AI is truly a Jr Engineer, code quality will regress (GitClear has related research on this <https://www.gitclear.com/coding_on_copilot_data_shows_ais_downward_pressure_on_code_quality>)
