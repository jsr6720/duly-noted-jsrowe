> Hinton’s advice for students is to focus on skills like math, statistics, probability, and linear algebra. These are long-lasting skills that won’t disappear, even as AI becomes more powerful.
> He also suggests learning to code, even if AI may handle most of it in the future. He compares it to learning Latin: you might never use the language in daily life, but learning it still strengthens your thinking.

right because "Math major" really makes you think "job security"? I wish he framing around "job loss" would focus more on "task loss". I add no value to the organization writing one line or one million lines. I add value by delivering working software (see simon duly noted)
