> AI is increasingly automating many coding tasks, accelerating software development. As models and tools improve, we see the automation of more complex coding tasks under developersâ€™ orchestration (like the ones we interviewed). This is already reality and no longer a future trend.


I think the reality is no one ever cared how nice my lines of code were. Anyone outside of software just wants the damn thing to work. SO using AI is just another tool. Adopt it.
