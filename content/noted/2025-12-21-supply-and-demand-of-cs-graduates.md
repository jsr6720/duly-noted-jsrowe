> Students at engineering colleges in India, China, Dubai, and Kenya are facing a “jobpocalypse” as artificial intelligence replaces humans in entry-level roles. Tasks once assigned to fresh graduates, such as debugging, testing, and routine software maintenance, are now increasingly automated.
> 
> Over the last three years, the number of fresh graduates hired by big tech companies globally has declined by more than 50%,

Demand slumped. Supply is huge. Macroeconomics at work regardless of the hurt feelings.
