> Because most BNPL loans aren’t reported to credit bureaus, they create what regulators call “phantom debt.” That means other lenders can’t see when someone has taken out five different BNPL loans across multiple platforms. The credit system is flying blind.

I think this is changing or has changed recently. but very troubling that many of these services are being used to pay for groceries and basics.
