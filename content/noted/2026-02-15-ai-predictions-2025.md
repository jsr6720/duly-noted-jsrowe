> In 2025, some people will try to convince you GenAI is the solution to all humanity's problems, while others will try to convince you it's the end of humanity. In the middle of all this, others will try to research and quantify its impacts and keep the dialogue sober and rational. However, most public discourse will ignore them because their views are too dull.

lol. bet.
