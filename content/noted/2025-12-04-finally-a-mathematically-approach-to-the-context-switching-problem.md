> It’s also why five 10-minute blocks don’t add up to one 50-minute block. When things are below your theta, things just don’t compound. Another way to think of this as fragmentation: interruptions can break your time into pieces too small to be useful, even if the total time is the same.

So good I wish I could bookmark it twice. Dives deep (pun intended) on how powerful getting into a flow state is for deep work.
