>  But research found a deeper problem: the AI tools didn't learn. They couldn't retain context or improve over time. In simple terms, the AI was intelligent but suffered from amnesia after every interaction. This is the illusion many firms fall into. They think they have a smart system, but what they really have is a stateless algorithm that never improves.

This one caught my eye the most. Deploying an "AI" bot without recursive learning is no better than the old school 'chat bots'. The only value in deploying AI is if. you can build a virtuous data cycle that feeds interactions into itself improving the model along the way.
