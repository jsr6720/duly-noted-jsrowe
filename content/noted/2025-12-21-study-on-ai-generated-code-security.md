>  Disturbingly, all agents perform poorly in terms of software security. Although 61% of the solutions from SWE-Agent with Claude 4 Sonnet are functionally correct, only 10.5% are secure.

right but how many solutions are secure without AI involvement? Or I suppose they're testing just first response generation?
