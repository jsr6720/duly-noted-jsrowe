> The first figure plots overall adoption rates, both for work and for nonwork, from August 2024 to August 2025. Our survey found that in August 2024, 44.6% of adults ages 18 to 64 used generative AI overall.1 In the last 12 months, adoption of this new technology increased by 10 percentage points to 54.6%.

I really trust the st Louis fed to give me a much more realistic number on AI adoption. Remember software is only ~4% of the job market.

We pooled the data from our February, May and August 2025 surveys, and then calculated the aggregate time savings. Factoring in all workers, including nonusers, workers report generative AI time savings equivalent to 1.6% of all work hours.I mean this largely tracks across the entire economy. There have been other studies that have suggested as high as 5% when measured across entire job categories. 

But AI is all about accelerating TASKS and in that realm it is undefeated. Or so i think https://xkcd.com/1319/ https://xkcd.com/1319/and https://xkcd.com/1205/ always make me laugh.
