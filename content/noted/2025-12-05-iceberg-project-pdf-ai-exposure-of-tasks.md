> The labor market is evolving faster than current data systems can capture. AI automates some
skills and augments others, creating uneven effects across industries and regions. Much of this
activity occurs on digital platforms—gig marketplaces, AI copilots, freelance networks—that
fall outside conventional reporting [23]. By the time these changes appear in official statistics,
policymakers may already be reacting to yesterday’s disruptions, committing billions to programs
that target skills already displaced. Without forward-looking capability to test strategies before
implementation, states cannot distinguish investments that prepare workers from those that
arrive too late.

There's a lot going on in this report, it's been cited as heavily impacting people. But I think the more damning thing is that we're using 20th century metrics like GDP and W2 payroll taxes in an economy that no longer bears those markers..
