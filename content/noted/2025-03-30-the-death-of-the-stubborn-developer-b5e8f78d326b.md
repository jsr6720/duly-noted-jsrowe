> So chatting is how programming is increasingly being conducted in the wild, as we speak .. and all coding, even updates, will eventually be done via chat. And remember, it’s chat with something that hallucinates wildly, so it’s not exactly the solid slam-dunk leap forward that we all wish it were. But it is such a boost that the economics are driving everyone that direction anyway. In my blog post I called this phenomenon Chat-Oriented Programming, CHOP for short (or just chop). Chop isn’t just the future, it’s the present. And if you’re not using it, you’re starting to fall behind the ones who are.

A follow on to the articles about how jr engineering is dead. But I think this is similar to other industries like surgery and airline pilots that take tremendous skill, but also are being automated. Leaving fewer learning opportunities for up and coming professionals.

I have made extensive use of chat programming, but found it only works for first passes and specific troubleshooting. Trying to get an LLM to make a specific change on line 23 is like herding cats.
