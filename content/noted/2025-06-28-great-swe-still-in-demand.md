> Engineers got used to those cushy jobs, and became the most spoiled profession out there. We work from a nice office (or your home), solve interesting problems, and get paid in the top 10% of our country to do it.

I once told a friend that SWE is unlike any other field. You don't have to chase certificates or slog 10 years in the pits. What other career can you say 'No I don't know the tech stack and I don't know the industry and I don't know the product' and hear back 'You're Hired'?
