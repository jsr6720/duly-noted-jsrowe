> Docusign’s fundamentals, according to Thygesen, are stronger than ever. While the company is known primarily as a platform for signing legally binding contracts, it recently launched an AI-powered platform that helps customers manage every aspect of the contract process, from creating documents to verifying the identities of signatories. The company uses a mix of in-house tools and AI models from third-party firms, including OpenAI.

At any rate I wouldn't trust an LLM with a signed document anyways. I'm a little confused by the original title. Just because a great LLM company says they're working on a new product doesn't mean it'll be great at it.
