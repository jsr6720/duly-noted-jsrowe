> I’ve seen so many bugs in real systems due to mixing up integers, strings, or UUIDs that represent different things. Meanwhile, it’s simple to set up types that entirely eliminate this class of bug, even in a language like Go that isn’t known for having a particularly powerful type system. It’s absolutely astounding to me that this technique is not broadly used.

I mean I get it. compiler catch everything. Bob Martin would be proud.
