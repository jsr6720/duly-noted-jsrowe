> Most powerful people are on the manager's schedule. It's the schedule of command. But there's another way of using time that's common among people who make things, like programmers and writers. They generally prefer to use time in units of half a day at least. You can't write or program well in units of an hour. That's barely enough time to get started.

I inherently feel this. My primary objective as a builder is large blocks of focus time. It can take up to 30-45 min to jsut reorient myself in whatever project I'm working on.
