> This isn't the 1-2 year thing of what happens when you have a super powerful software engineer. But over time, if everyone has these superhuman tools to create a ton of different stuff, you're going to get incredible diversity. Part of it is going to be solving hard problems: solving diseases, advancing science, developing new technology that makes our lives better. But I would guess that a lot of it is going to end up being cultural and social pursuits and entertainment. I would guess the world is going to get a lot funnier, weirder, and quirkier, the way that memes on the internet have gotten over the last 10 years.

Transcript of a video interview. Zuckerbert posits that with less effort spent on working more creative pursuits will be pursued. I still think human memes are top notch.
