> For over a decade, my dopamine (from work) came from a very predictable place: shipping new things. As a manager, those direct rewards will simply disappear, leaving you feeling unfulfilled for weeks (months in my case).

This hit home. And yes you too one day will be on a red team/warroom call remembering your glory days of diving deep figuring out the problem and feeling the accolades. Being a manager is a lot more pointing the spotlight than basking in it, rightfully so. As a manager suddenly results and rettenion matter most. Well Matheus puts it as 'Shipping' and 'Happy' which are results and retention oriented!
