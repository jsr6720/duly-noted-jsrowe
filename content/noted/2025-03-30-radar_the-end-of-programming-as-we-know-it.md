> Bret told me that he believes that a company’s AI agent will become its primary digital interface, as significant as its website, as significant as its mobile app, perhaps even more so. A company’s AI agent will have to encode all of its key business policies and processes.

> What is programming, after all, but the way that humans get computers to do our bidding? The fact that 'programming' is getting closer and closer to human language, that our machines can understand us rather than us having to speak to them in their native tongue of 0s and 1s, or some specialized programming language pidgin, should be cause for celebration.

Deep analysis of AI market and future. I do agree with Bret that an AI agent, or many, will be a primary competitive advantage in the way that early chat bots helped automate routine questions, and phone trees before that. 

Does it suck to be on the other end yelling \"Operator!\". Of course, but do I want to go back to a pool of people with the skills and fortitude to do more, just to tell me my bank balance? No.
